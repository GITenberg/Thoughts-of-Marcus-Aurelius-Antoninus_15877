<h2>OF</h2>

<h2>MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS.</h2>


<p>M. Antoninus was born at Rome, A.D. 121, on the 26th of April.
His father, Annius Verus, died while he was praetor. His mother was
Domitia Calvilla, also named Lucilla. The Emperor T. Antoninus Pius
married Annia Galeria Faustina, the sister of Annius Verus, and was
consequently the uncle of M. Antoninus. When Hadrian adopted
Antoninus Pius and declared him his successor in the empire,
Antoninus Pius adopted both L. Ceionius Commodus, the son of Aelius
Caesar, and M. Antoninus, whose original name was M. Annius Verus.
Antoninus then took the name of M. Aelius Aurelius Verus, to which
was added the title of Caesar in A.D. 139: the name Aelius belonged
to Hadrian's family, and Aurelius was the name of Antoninus Pius.
When M. Antoninus became Augustus, he dropped the name of Verus and
took the name of Antoninus. Accordingly he is generally named M.
Aurelius Antoninus, or simply M. Antoninus.</p>

<p>The youth was most carefully brought up. He thanks the gods (<a
href="#i._17">i. 17</a>) that he had good grandfathers, good
parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good
kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good. He had the happy
fortune to witness the example of his uncle and adoptive father
Antoninus Pius, and he has recorded in his word (<a href=
"#i._16">i. 16</a>; <a href="#vi._30">vi. 30</a>) the virtues of
the excellent man and prudent ruler. Like many young Romans he
tried his hand at poetry and studied rhetoric. Herodes Atticus and
M. Cornelius Fronto were his teachers in eloquence. There are
extant letters between Fronto and Marcus,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id=
"FNanchor_A_1" /><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
which show the great affection of the pupil for the master, and the
master's great hopes of his industrious pupil. M. Antoninus
mentions Fronto (<a href="#i._11">i. 11</a>) among those to whom
he was indebted for his education.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a> M. Cornelii
Frontonis Reliquiae, Berlin, 1816. There are a few letters between
Fronto and Antoninus Pius.</p>
</div>

<p>When he was eleven years old, he assumed the dress of
philosophers, something plain and coarse, became a hard student,
and lived a most laborious, abstemious life, even so far as to
injure his health. Finally, he abandoned poetry and rhetoric for
philosophy, and he attached himself to the sect of the Stoics. But
he did not neglect the study of law, which was a useful preparation
for the high place which he was designed to fill. His teacher was
L. Volusianus Maecianus, a distinguished jurist. We must suppose
that he learned the Roman discipline of arms, which was a necessary
part of the education of a man who afterwards led his troops to
battle against a warlike race.</p>

<p>Antoninus has recorded in his first book the names of his
teachers, and the obligations which he owed to each of them. The
way in which he speaks of what he learned from them might seem to
savor of vanity or self-praise, if we look carelessly at the way in
which he has expressed himself; but if any one draws this
conclusion, he will be mistaken. Antoninus means to commemorate the
merits of his several teachers, what they taught, and what a pupil
might learn from them. Besides, this book, like the eleven other
books, was for his own use; and if we may trust the note at the end
of the first book, it was written during one of M. Antoninus'
campaigns against the Quadi, at a time when the commemoration of
the virtues of his illustrious teachers might remind him of their
lessons and the practical uses which he might derive from them.</p>

<p>Among his teachers of philosophy was Sextus of Chaeroneia, a
grandson of Plutarch. What he learned from this excellent man is
told by himself (<a href="#i._9">i. 9</a>). His favorite teacher
was Q. Junius Rusticus (<a href="#i._7">i. 7</a>), a philosopher,
and also a man of practical good sense in public affairs. Rusticus
was the adviser of Antoninus after he became emperor. Young men who
are destined for high places are not often fortunate in those who
are about them, their companions and teachers; and I do not know
any example of a young prince having had an education which can be
compared with that of M. Antoninus. Such a body of teachers
distinguished by their acquirements and their character will hardly
be collected again; and as to the pupil, we have not had one like
him since.</p>

<p>Hadrian died in July A.D. 138, and was succeeded by Antoninus
Pius. M. Antoninus married Faustina, his cousin, the daughter of
Pius, probably about A.D. 146, for he had a daughter born in 147.
He received from his adoptive father the title of Caesar, and was
associated with him in the administration of the state. The father
and the adopted son lived together in perfect friendship and
confidence. Antoninus was a dutiful son, and the emperor Pius loved
and esteemed him.</p>

<p>Antoninus Pius died in March, A.D. 161. The Senate, it is said,
urged M. Antoninus to take the sole administration of the empire,
but he associated with himself the other adopted son of Pius, L.
Ceionius Commodus, who is generally called L. Verus. Thus Rome for
the first time had two emperors. Verus was an indolent man of
pleasure, and unworthy of his station. Antoninus however bore with
him, and it is said Verus had sense enough to pay to his colleague
the respect due to his character. A virtuous emperor and a loose
partner lived together in peace, and their alliance was
strengthened by Antoninus giving to Verus for wife his daughter
Lucilla.</p>

<p>The reign of Antoninus was first troubled by a Parthian war, in
which Verus was sent to command; but he did nothing, and the
success that was obtained by the Romans in Armenia and on the
Euphrates and Tigris was due to his generals. This Parthian war
ended in A.D. 165. Aurelius and Verus had a triumph (A.D. 166) for
the victories in the East. A pestilence followed, which carried off
great numbers in Rome and Italy, and spread to the west of
Europe.</p>

<p>The north of Italy was also threatened by the rude people beyond
the Alps, from the borders of Gallia to the eastern side of the
Hadriatic. These barbarians attempted to break into Italy, as the
Germanic nations had attempted near three hundred years before; and
the rest of the life of Antoninus, with some intervals, was
employed in driving back the invaders. In 169 Verus suddenly died,
and Antoninus administered the state alone.</p>

<p>During the German wars Antoninus resided for three years on the
Danube at Carnuntum. The Marcomanni were driven out of Pannonia and
almost destroyed in their retreat across the Danube; and in A.D.
174 the emperor gained a great victory over the Quadi.</p>

<p>In A.D. 175, Avidius Cassius, a brave and skilful Roman
commander who was at the head of the troops in Asia, revolted, and
declared himself Augustus. But Cassius was assassinated by some of
his officers, and so the rebellion came to an end. Antoninus showed
his humanity by his treatment of the family and the partisans of
Cassius; and his letter to the Senate, in which he recommends
mercy, is extant. (Vulcatius, Avidius Cassius, c. 12.)</p>

<p>Antoninus set out for the East on hearing of Cassius' revolt.
Though he appears to have returned to Rome in A.D. 174, he went
back to prosecute the war against the Germans, and it is probable
that he marched direct to the East from the German war. His wife
Faustina, who accompanied him into Asia, died suddenly at the foot
of the Taurus, to the great grief of her husband. Capitolinus, who
has written the life of Antoninus, and also Dion Cassius, accuses
the empress of scandalous infidelity to her husband, and of
abominable lewdness. But Capitolinus says that Antoninus either
knew it not or pretended not to know it. Nothing is so common as
such malicious reports in all ages, and the history of imperial
Rome is full of them. Antoninus loved his wife, and he says that
she was "obedient, affectionate, and simple." The same scandal had
been spread about Faustina's mother, the wife of Antoninus Pius,
and yet he too was perfectly satisfied with his wife. Antoninus
Pius says after her death, in a letter to Fronto, that he would
rather have lived in exile with his wife than in his palace at Rome
without her. There are not many men who would give their wives a
better character than these two emperors. Capitolinus wrote in the
time of Diocletian. He may have intended to tell the truth, but he
is a poor, feeble biographer. Dion Cassius, the most malignant of
historians, always reports, and perhaps he believed, any scandal
against anybody.</p>

<p>Antoninus continued his journey to Syria and Egypt, and on his
return to Italy through Athens he was initiated into the Eleusinian
mysteries. It was the practice of the emperor to conform to the
established rites of the age, and to perform religious ceremonies
with due solemnity. We cannot conclude from this that he was a
superstitious man, though we might perhaps do so if his book did
not show that he was not. But that is only one among many instances
that a ruler's public acts do not always prove his real opinions. A
prudent governor will not roughly oppose even the superstitions of
his people; and though he may wish they were wiser, he will know
that he cannot make them so by offending their prejudices.</p>

<p>Antoninus and his son Commodus entered Rome in triumph, perhaps
for some German victories, on the 23d. of December, A.D. 176. In
the following year Commodus was associated with his father in the
empire, and took the name of Augustus. This year A.D. 177 is
memorable in ecclesiastical history. Attalus and others were put to
death at Lyon for their adherence to the Christian religion. The
evidence of this persecution is a letter preserved by Eusebius
(E.H. V. I; printed in Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. i, with
notes). The letter is from the Christians of Vienna and Lugdunum in
Gallia (Vienna and Lyon) to their Christian brethren in Asia and
Phrygia; and it is preserved perhaps nearly entire. It contains a
very particular description of the tortures inflicted on the
Christians in Gallia, and it states that while the persecution was
going on, Attalus, a Christian and a Roman citizen, was loudly
demanded by the populace and brought into the amphitheatre; but the
governor ordered him to be reserved, with the rest who were in
prison, until he had received instructions from the emperor. Many
had been tortured before the governor thought of applying to
Antoninus. The imperial rescript, says the letter, was that the
Christians should be punished, but if they would deny their faith,
they must be released. On this the work began again. The Christians
who were Roman citizens were beheaded; the rest were exposed to the
wild beasts in the amphitheatre. Some modern writers on
ecclesiastical history, when they use this letter, say nothing of
the wonderful stories of the martyrs' sufferings. Sanctus, as the
letter says, was burnt with plates of hot iron till his body was
one sore and had lost all human form; but on being put to the rack
he recovered his former appearance under the torture, which was
thus a cure instead of a punishment. He was afterwards torn by
beasts, and placed on an iron chair and roasted. He died at
last.</p>

<p>The letter is one piece of evidence. The writer, whoever he was
that wrote in the name of the Gallic Christians, is our evidence
both for the ordinary and the extraordinary circumstances of the
story, and we cannot accept his evidence for one part and reject
the other. We often receive small evidence as a proof of a thing we
believe to be within the limits of probability or possibility, and
we reject exactly the same evidence, when the thing to which it
refers appears very improbable or impossible. But this is a false
method of inquiry, though it is followed by some modern writers,
who select what they like from a story and reject the rest of the
evidence; or if they do not reject it, they dishonestly suppress
it. A man can only act consistently by accepting all this letter or
rejecting it all, and we cannot blame him for either. But he who
rejects it may still admit that such a letter may be founded on
real facts; and he would make this admission as the most probable
way of accounting for the existence of the letter; but if, as he
would suppose, the writer has stated some things falsely, he cannot
tell what part of his story is worthy of credit.</p>

<p>The war on the northern frontier appears to have been
uninterrupted during the visit of Antoninus to the East, and on his
return the emperor again left Rome to oppose the barbarians. The
Germanic people were defeated in a great battle A.D. 179. During
this campaign the emperor was seized with some contagious malady,
of which he died in the camp at Sirmium (Mitrovitz), on the Save,
in Lower Pannonia, but at Vindebona (Vienna), according to other
authorities, on the 17th of March, A.D. 180, in the fifty-ninth
year of his age. His son Commodus was with him. The body, or the
ashes probably, of the emperor were carried to Rome, and he
received the honor of deification. Those who could afford it had
his statue or bust; and when Capitolinus wrote, many people still
had statues of Antoninus among the Dei Penates or household
deities. He was in a manner made a saint. Commodus erected to the
memory of his father the Antonine column which is now in the Piazza
Colonna at Rome. The <i>bassi rilievi</i> which are placed in a
spiral line round the shaft commemorate the victories of Antoninus
over the Marcomanni and the Quadi, and the miraculous shower of
rain which refreshed the Roman soldiers and discomfited their
enemies. The statue of Antoninus was placed on the capital of the
column, but it was removed at some time unknown, and a bronze
statue of St. Paul was put in the place by Pope Sixtus the
fifth.</p>

<p>The historical evidence for the times of Antoninus is very
defective, and some of that which remains is not credible. The most
curious is the story about the miracle which happened in A.D. 174,
during the war with the Quadi. The Roman army was in danger of
perishing by thirst, but a sudden storm drenched them with rain,
while it discharged fire and hail on their enemies, and the Romans
gained a great victory. All the authorities which speak of the
battle speak also of the miracle. The Gentile writers assign it to
their gods, and the Christians to the intercession of the Christian
legion in the emperor's army. To confirm the Christian statement it
is added that the emperor gave the title of Thundering to this
legion; but Dacier and others, who maintain the Christian report of
the miracle, admit that this title of Thundering or Lightning was
not given to this legion because the Quadi were struck with
lightning, but because there was a figure of lightning on their
shields, and that this title of the legion existed in the time of
Augustus. Scaliger also had observed that the legion was called
Thundering
<ins class="greek" title="Greek: keraunobolos">(&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&upsilon;&nu;&omicron;&beta;&#x3cc;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>
or
<ins class="greek" title="Greek: keraunophoros">&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&upsilon;&nu;&omicron;&phi;&#x3cc;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</ins>
before the reign of Antoninus. We learn this from Dion Cassius
(Lib. 55, c. 23, and the note of Reimarus), who enumerates all the
legions of Augustus' time. The name Thundering of Lightning also
occurs on an inscription of the reign of Trajan, which was found at
Trieste. Eusebius (v. 5), when he relates the miracle, quotes
Apolinarius, bishop of Hierapolis, as authority for this name being
given to the legion Melitene by the emperor in consequence of the
success which he obtained through their prayers; from which we may
estimate the value of Apolinarius' testimony. Eusebius does not say
in what book of Apolinarius the statement occurs. Dion says that
the Thundering legion was stationed in Cappadocia in the time of
Augustus. Valesius also observes that in the Notitia of the
Imperium Romanum there is mentioned under the commander of Armenia
the Praefectura of the twelfth legion named "Thundering Melitene;"
and this position in Armenia will agree with what Dion says of its
position in Cappadocia. Accordingly Valesius concludes that
Melitene was not the name of the legion, but of the town in which
it was stationed. Melitene was also the name of the district in
which this town was situated. The legions did not, he says, take
their name from the place where they were on duty, but from the
country in which they were raised, and therefore what Eusebius says
about the Melitene does not seem probable to him. Yet Valesius, on
the authority of Apolinarius and Tertullian, believed that the
miracle was worked through the prayers of the Christian soldiers in
the emperor's army. Rufinus does not give the name of Melitene to
this legion, says Valesius, and probably he purposely omitted it,
because he knew that Melitene was the name of a town in Armenia
Minor, where the legion was stationed in his time.</p>

<p>The emperor, it is said, made a report of his victory to the
Senate, which we may believe, for such was the practice; but we do
not know what he said in his letter, for it is not extant. Dacier
assumes that the emperor's letter was purposely destroyed by the
Senate or the enemies of Christianity, that so honorable a
testimony to the Christians and their religion might not be
perpetuated. The critic has however not seen that he contradicts
himself when he tells us the purport of the letter, for he says
that it was destroyed, and even Eusebius could not find it. But
there does exist a letter in Greek addressed by Antoninus to the
Roman people and the sacred Senate after this memorable victory. It
is sometimes printed after Justin's first Apology, but it is
totally unconnected with the apologies. This letter is one of the
most stupid forgeries of the many which exist, and it cannot be
possibly founded even on the genuine report of Antoninus to the
Senate. If it were genuine, it would free the emperor from the
charge of persecuting men because they were Christians, for he says
in this false letter that if a man accuse another only of being a
Christian, and the accused confess, and there is nothing else
against him, he must be set free; with this monstrous addition,
made by a man inconceivably ignorant, that the informer must be
burnt alive.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_2">[A]</a> Eusebius (v. 5)
quotes Tertullian's Apology to the Roman Senate in confirmation of
the story. Tertullian, he says, writes that letters of the emperor
were extant, in which he declares that his army was saved by the
prayers of the Christians; and that he "threatened to punish with
death those who ventured to accuse us." It is possible that the
forged letter which is now extant may be one of those which
Tertullian had seen, for he uses the plural number, "letters." A
great deal has been written about this miracle of the Thundering
Legion, and more than is worth reading. There is a dissertation on
this supposed miracle in Moyle's Works, London, 1726.</p>
</div>

<p>During the time of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Antoninus there
appeared the first Apology of Justinus, and under M. Antoninus the
Oration of Tatian against the Greeks, which was a fierce attack on
the established religions; the address of Athenagoras to M.
Antoninus on behalf of the Christians, and the Apology of Melito,
bishop of Sardes, also addressed to the emperor, and that of
Apolinarius. The first Apology of Justinus is addressed to T.
Antoninus Pius and his two adopted sons, M. Antoninus and L. Verus;
but we do not know whether they read it.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id=
"FNanchor_A_3" /><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The second Apology of Justinus is entitled "to the Roman Senate;"
but this superscription is from some copyist. In the first chapter
Justinus addresses the Romans. In the second chapter he speaks of
an affair that had recently happened in the time of M. Antoninus
and L,. Verus, as it seems; and he also directly addresses the
emperor, saying of a certain woman, "she addressed a petition to
thee, the emperor, and thou didst grant the petition." In other
passages the writer addresses the two emperors, from which we must
conclude that the Apology was directed to them. Eusebius (E.H. iv.
18) states that the second Apology was addressed to the successor
of Antoninus Pius, and he names him Antoninus Verus, meaning M.
Antoninus. In one passage of this second Apology (c. 8), Justinus,
or the writer, whoever he may be, says that even men who followed
the Stoic doctrines, when they ordered their lives according to
ethical reason, were hated and murdered, such as Heraclitus,
Musonius in his own times, and others; for all those who in any way
labored to live according to reason and avoided wickedness were
always hated; and this was the effect of the work of daemons.</p>

Otto, vol. ii. 559. "Junius Rusticus Praefectus Urbi erat sub

Orat. xxxiv Dindorf. p. 451, et ex quodam illorum rescripto, Dig.
49. 1. I, &sect; 2" (Otto). The rescript contains the words "Junium
Rusticum amicum nostrum Praefectum Urbi." The Martyrium of Justinus
and others is written in Greek. It begins, "In the time of the
wicked defenders of idolatry impious edicts were published against
the pious Christians both in cities and country places, for the
purpose of compelling them to make offerings to vain idols.
Accordingly the holy men (Justinus, Chariton, a woman Charito,
Paeon, Liberianus, and others) were brought before Rusticus, the
praefect of Rome."</p>

<p>The Martyrium gives the examination of the accused by Rusticus.
All of them professed to be Christians. Justinus was asked if he
expected to ascend into heaven and to receive a reward for his
sufferings, if he was condemned to death. He answered that he did
not expect: he was certain of it. Finally, the test of obedience
was proposed to the prisoners; they were required to sacrifice to
the gods. All refused, and Rusticus pronounced the sentence, which
was that those who refused to sacrifice to the gods and obey the
emperor's order should be whipped and beheaded according to the
law. The martyrs were then led to the usual place of execution and
beheaded. Some of the faithful secretly carried off the bodies and
deposited them in a fit place.</p>

<p>The persecution in which Polycarp suffered at Smyrna belongs to
the time of M. Antoninus. The evidence for it is the letter of the
church of Smyrna to the churches of Philomelium and the other
Christian churches, and it is preserved by Eusebius (E.H. iv. 15).
But the critics do not agree about the time of Polycarp's death,
differing in the two extremes to the amount of twelve years. The
circumstances of Polycarp's martyrdom were accompanied by miracles,
one of which Eusebius (<a href="#iv._15">iv. 15</a>) has omitted,
but it appears in the oldest Latin version of the letter, which
Usher published, and it is supposed that this version was made not
long after the time of Eusebius. The notice at the end of the
letter states that it was transcribed by Caius from the copy of
Irenaeus, the disciple of Polycarp, then transcribed by Socrates at
Corinth; "after which I Pionius again wrote it out from the copy
above mentioned, having searched it out by the revelation of
Polycarp, who directed me to it," &amp;c. The story of Polycarp's
martyrdom is embellished with miraculous circumstances which some
modern writers on ecclesiastical history take the liberty of
omitting.<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5" /><a href=

Middleton says that Eusebius omitted to mention the dove, which
flew out of Polycarp's body, and Dodwell and Archbishop Wake have
done the same. Wake says, "I am so little a friend to such miracles
that I thought it better with Eusebius to omit that circumstance

<p>In order to form a proper notion of the condition of the
Christians under M. Antoninus we must go back to Trajan's time.
When the younger Pliny was governor of Bithynia, the Christians
were numerous in those parts, and the worshipers of the old
religion were falling off. The temples were deserted, the festivals
neglected, and there were no purchasers of victims for sacrifice.
Those who were interested in the maintenance of the old religion
thus found that their profits were in danger. Christians of both
sexes and all ages were brought before the governor who did not
know what to do with them. He could come to no other conclusion
than this, that those who confessed to be Christians and persevered
in their religion ought to be punished; if for nothing else, for
their invincible obstinancy. He found no crimes proved against the
Christians, and he could only characterize their religion as a
depraved and extravagant superstition, which might be stopped if
the people were allowed the opportunity of recanting. Pliny wrote
this in a letter to Trajan (Plinius, Ep. x. 97). He asked for the
emperor's directions, because he did not know what to do. He
remarks that he had never been engaged in judicial inquiries about
the Christians, and that accordingly he did not know what to
inquire about, or how far to inquire and punish. This proves that
it was not a new thing to examine into a man's profession of
Christianity and to punish him for it.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id=

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_6" id="Footnote_A_6" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_6">[A]</a> Orosius (vii.
12) speaks of Trajan's persecution of the Christians, and of
Pliny's application to him having led the emperor to mitigate his
severity. The punishment by the Mosaic law for those who attempted
to seduce the Jews to follow new gods was death. If a man was
secretly enticed to such new worship, he must kill the seducer,
even if the seducer were brother, son, daughter, wife, or friend.
(Deut. xiii.)</p>
</div>

<p>Trajan's rescript is extant. He approved of the governor's
judgment in the matter, but he said that no search must be made
after the Christians; if a man was charged with the new religion
and convicted, he must not be punished if he affirmed that he was
not a Christian, and confirmed his denial by showing his reverence
to the heathen gods. He added that no notice must be taken of
anonymous informations, for such things were of bad example. Trajan
was a mild and sensible man; and both motives of mercy and policy
probably also induced him to take as little notice of the
Christians as he could, to let them live in quiet if it were
possible. Trajan's rescript is the first legislative act of the
head of the Roman state with reference to Christianity, which is
known to us. It does not appear that the Christians were further
disturbed under his reign. The martyrdom of Ignatius by the order
of Trajan himself is not universally admitted to be an historical
fact.<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7" /><a href=

<p>In the time of Hadrian it was no longer possible for the Roman
government to overlook the great increase of the Christians and the
hostility of the common sort to them. If the governors in the
provinces were willing to let them alone, they could not resist the
fanaticism of the heathen community, who looked on the Christians
as atheists. The Jews too, who were settled all over the Roman
Empire, were as hostile to the Christians as the Gentiles were.<a

class="fnanchor">[A]</a> With the time of Hadrian begin the
Christian Apologies, which show plainly what the popular feeling
towards the Christians then was. A rescript of Hadrian to Minucius

Justin's first Apology,<a name="FNanchor_B_9" id=
"FNanchor_B_9" /><a href="#Footnote_B_9" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
instructs the governor that innocent people must not be troubled,
and false accusers must not be allowed to extort money from them;
the charges against the Christians must be made in due form, and no
attention must be paid to popular clamors; when Christians were
regularly prosecuted and convicted of illegal acts, they must be
punished according to their deserts; and false accusers also must
be punished. Antoninus Pius is said to have published rescripts to
the same effect. The terms of Hadrian's rescript seem very
favorable to the Christians; but if we understand it in this sense,
that they were only to be punished like other people for illegal
acts, it would have had no meaning, for that could have been done
without asking the emperor's advice. The real purpose of the
rescript is that Christians must be punished if they persisted in
their belief, and would not prove their renunciation of it by
acknowledging the heathen religion. This was Trajan's rule, and we
have no reason for supposing that Hadrian granted more to the
Christians than Trajan did. There is also printed at the end of
Justin's first Apology a rescript of Antoninus Pius to the Commune
of

<ins class="greek"

and it is also in Eusebius (E.H.
iv. 13). The date of the rescript is the third consulship of
Antoninus Pius.<a name="FNanchor_C_10" id="FNanchor_C_10" /><a
href="#Footnote_C_10" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The rescript
declares that the Christians&mdash;for they are meant, though the
name Christians does not occur in the rescript&mdash;were not to be
disturbed unless they were attempting something against the Roman
rule; and no man was to be punished simply for being a Christian.
But this rescript is spurious. Any man moderately acquainted with
Roman history will see by the style and tenor that it is a clumsy
forgery.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_8" id="Footnote_A_8" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_8">[A]</a> We have the
evidence of Justinus (ad Diognetum, c. 5) to this effect: "The
Christians are attacked by the Jews as if they were men of a
different race, and are persecuted by the Greeks; and those who
hate them cannot give the reason of their enmity."</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_B_9" id="Footnote_B_9" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_B_9">[B]</a> And in Eusebius
(E.H. iv. 8, 9). Orosius (vii. 13) says that Hadrian sent this
rescript to Minucius Fundanus, proconsul of Asia after being
instructed in books written on the Christian religion by Quadratus,
a disciple of the Apostles, and Aristides, an Athenian, an honest
and wise man, and Serenus Granius. In the Greek text of Hadrian's
rescript there is mentioned Serenius Granianus, the predecessor of
Minucius Fundanus in the government of <i>Asia</i>.</p>

<p>This rescript of Hadrian has clearly been added to the Apology
by some editor. The Apology ends with the words:

<ins class="greek"

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_C_10" id="Footnote_C_10" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_C_10">[C]</a> Eusebius (E.H.
iv. 12), after giving the beginning of Justinus' first Apology,
which contains the address to T. Antoninus and his two adopted
sons, adds: "The same emperor being addressed by other brethren in
Asia, honored the Commune of Asia with the following rescript."
This rescript, which is in the next chapter of Eusebius (E.H. iv.
13) is in the sole name of Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
Augustus Armenius, though Eusebius had just before said that he was
going to give us a rescript of Antoninus Pius. There are some
material variations between the two copies of the rescript besides
the difference in the title, which difference makes it impossible
to say whether the forger intended to assign this rescript to Pius
or to M. Antoninus.</p>

<p>The author of the Alexandrine Chronicum says that Marcus, being
moved by the entreaties of Melito and other heads of the church,
wrote an Epistle to the Commune of Asia in which he forbade the
Christians to be troubled on account of their religion. Valesius
supposes this to be the letter or rescript which is contained in
Eusebius (iv. 13), and to be the answer to the Apology of Melito,
of which I shall soon give the substance. But Marcus certainly did
not write this letter which is in Eusebius, and we know not what
answer he made to Melito.</p>
</div>

<p>In the time of M. Antoninus the opposition between the old and
the new belief was still stronger, and the adherents of the heathen
religion urged those in authority to a more regular resistance to
the invasions of the Christian faith. Melito in his Apology to M.
Antoninus represents the Christians of Asia as persecuted under new
imperial orders. Shameless informers, he says, men who were greedy
after the property of others, used these orders as a means of
robbing those who were doing no harm. He doubts if a just emperor
could have ordered anything so unjust; and if the last order was
really not from the emperor, the Christians entreat him not to give
them up to their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_A_11" id=
"FNanchor_A_11" /><a href="#Footnote_A_11" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
We conclude from this that there were at least imperial rescripts
or constitutions of M. Antoninus which were made the foundation of
these persecutions. The fact of being a Christian was now a crime
and punished, unless the accused denied their religion. Then come
the persecutions at Smyrna, which some modern critics place in A.D.
167, ten years before the persecution of Lyon. The governors of the
provinces under M. Antoninus might have found enough even in
Trajan's rescript to warrant them in punishing Christians, and the
fanaticism of the people would drive them to persecution, even if
they were unwilling. But besides the fact of the Christians
rejecting all the heathen ceremonies, we must not forget that they
plainly maintain that all the heathen religions were false. The
Christians thus declared war against the heathen rites, and it is
hardly necessary to observe that this was a declaration of
hostility against the Roman government, which tolerated all the
various forms of superstition that existed in the empire, and could
not consistently tolerate another religion, which declared that all
the rest were false and all the splendid ceremonies of the empire
only a worship of devils.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_11" id="Footnote_A_11" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_11">[A]</a> Eusebius, iv.
26; and Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. I, and the notes. The
interpretation of this Fragment is not easy. Mosheim misunderstood
one passage so far as to affirm that Marcus promised rewards to
those who denounced the Christians; an interpretation which is
entirely false. Melito calls the Christian religion "our
philosophy," which began among barbarians (the Jews), and
flourished among the Roman subjects in the time of Augustus, to the
great advantage of the empire, for from that time the power of the
Romans grew great and glorious. He says that the emperor has and
will have as the successor to Augustus' power the good wishes of
men, if he will protect that philosophy which grew up with the
empire and began with Augustus, which philosophy the predecessors
of Antoninus honored in addition to the other religions. He further
says that the Christian religion had suffered no harm since the
time of Augustus, but on the contrary had enjoyed all honor and
respect that any man could desire. Nero and Domitian, he says, were
alone persuaded by some malicious men to calumniate the Christian
religion, and this was the origin of the false charges against the
Christians. But this was corrected by the emperors who immediately
preceded Antoninus, who often by their rescripts reproved those who
attempted to trouble the Christians. Hadrian, Antoninus'
grandfather, wrote to many, and among them to Fundanus, the
governor of Asia. Antoninus Pius, when Marcus was associated with
him in the empire, wrote to the cities that they must not trouble
the Christians; among others, to the people of Larissa,
Thessalonica, the Athenians, and all the Greeks. Melito concluded
thus: "We are persuaded that thou who hast about these things the
same mind that they had, nay rather one much more humane and
philosophical, wilt do all that we ask thee."&mdash;This Apology
was written after A.D. 169, the year in which Verus died, for it
speaks of Marcus only and his son Commodus. According to Melito's
testimony, Christians had only been punished for their religion in
the time of Nero and Domitian, and the persecutions began again in
the time of M. Antoninus, and were founded on his orders, which
were abused, as he seems to mean. He distinctly affirms "that the
race of the godly is now persecuted and harassed by fresh imperial
orders in Asia, a thing which had never happened before." But we
know that all this is not true, and that Christians had been
punished in Trajan's time.</p>
</div>

<p>If we had a true ecclesiastical history, we should know how the
Roman emperors attempted to check the new religion; how they
enforced their principle of finally punishing Christians, simply as
Christians, which Justin in his Apology affirms that they did, and
I have no doubt that he tells the truth; how far popular clamor and
riots went in this matter, and how far many fanatical and ignorant
Christians&mdash;for there were many such&mdash;contributed to
excite the fanaticism on the other side and to embitter the quarrel
between the Roman government and the new religion. Our extant
ecclesiastical histories are manifestly falsified, and what truth
they contain is grossly exaggerated; but the fact is certain that
in the time of M. Antoninus the heathen populations were in open
hostility to the Christians, and that under Antoninus' rule men
were put to death because they were Christians. Eusebius, in the
preface to his fifth book, remarks that in the seventeenth year of
Antoninus' reign, in some parts of the world, the persecution of
the Christians became more violent, and that it proceeded from the
populace in the cities; and he adds, in his usual style of
exaggeration, that we may infer from what took place in a single
nation that myriads of martyrs were made in the habitable earth.
The nation which he alludes to is Gallia; and he then proceeds to
give the letter of the churches of Vienna and Lugdunum. It is
probable that he has <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: This is likely 'assigned'">assiged</ins> the true cause of the persecutions,
the fanaticism of the populace, and that both governors and emperor
had a great deal of trouble with these disturbances. How far Marcus
was cognizant of these cruel proceedings we do not know, for the
historical records of his reign are very defective. He did not make
the rule against the Christians, for Trajan did that; and if we
admit that he would have been willing to let the Christians alone,
we cannot affirm that it was in his power, for it would be a great
mistake to suppose that Antoninus had the unlimited authority which
some modern sovereigns have had. His power was limited by certain
constitutional forms, by the Senate, and by the precedents of his
predecessors. We cannot admit that such a man was an active
persecutor, for there is no evidence that he was,<a name=
"FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12" /><a href="#Footnote_A_12"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> though it is certain that he had no good
opinion of the Christians, as appears from his own words.<a name=
"FNanchor_B_13" id="FNanchor_B_13" /><a href="#Footnote_B_13"
class="fnanchor">[B]</a> But he knew nothing of them except their
hostility to the Roman religion, and he probably thought that they
were dangerous to the state, notwithstanding the professions, false
or true, of some of the Apologists. So much I have said, because it
would be unfair not to state all that can be urged against a man
whom his contemporaries and subsequent ages venerated as a model of
virtue and benevolence. If I admitted the genuineness of some
documents, he would be altogether clear from the charge of even
allowing any persecutions; but as I seek the truth and am sure that
they are false, I leave him to bear whatever blame is his due.<a
name="FNanchor_C_14" id="FNanchor_C_14" /><a href="#Footnote_C_14"
class="fnanchor">[C]</a> I add that it is quite certain that
Antoninus did not derive any of his ethical principles from a
religion of which he knew nothing.<a name="FNanchor_D_15" id=

emperor probably speaks of such fanatics as Clemens (quoted by
Gataker on this passage) mentions. The rational Christians admitted
no fellowship with them. "Some of these heretics," says Clemens,
"show their impiety and cowardice by loving their lives, saying
that the knowledge of the really existing God is true testimony
(martyrdom), but that a man is a self-murderer who bears witness by
his death. We also blame those who rush to death; for there are
some, not of us, but only bearing the same name, who give
themselves up. We say of them that they die without being martyrs,
even if they are publicly punished; and they give themselves up to
a death which avails nothing, as the Indian Gymnosophists give
themselves up foolishly to fire." Cave, in his primitive
Christianity (ii. c. 7), says of the Christians: "They did flock to
the place of torment faster than droves of beasts that are driven
to the shambles. They even longed to be in the arms of suffering.
Ignatius, though then in his journey to Rome in order to his
execution, yet by the way as he went could not but vent his
passionate desire of it 'Oh that I might come to those wild beasts
that are prepared for me; I heartily wish that I may presently meet
with them; I would invite and encourage them speedily to devour me,
and not be afraid to set upon me as they have been to others; nay,
should they refuse it, I would even force them to it;'" and more to
the same purpose from Eusebius. Cave, an honest and good man, says
all this in praise of the Christians; but I think that he mistook
the matter. We admire a man who holds to his principles even to
death; but these fanatical Christians are the Gymnosophists whom
Clemens treats with disdain.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the Emperor's Reflections&mdash;or his
Meditations, as they are generally named&mdash;is a genuine work.
In the first book he speaks of himself, his family, and his
teachers; and in other books he mentions himself. Suidas (v.
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: Márkos">&Mu;&#x1f71;&rho;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>) notices a work of
Antoninus in twelve books, which he names the "conduct of his own
life;" and he cites the book under several words in his Dictionary,
giving the emperor's name, but not the title of the work. There are
also passages cited by Suidas from Antoninus without mention of the
emperor's name. The true title of the work is unknown. Xylander,
who published the first edition of this book (Z&uuml;rich, 1558,
8vo, with a Latin version), used a manuscript which contained the
twelve books, but it is not known where the manuscript is now. The
only other complete manuscript which is known to exist is in the
Vatican library, but it has no title and no inscriptions of the
several books: the eleventh only has the inscription,
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: Márkou autokratoros">&Mu;&#x1f71;&rho;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;
&alpha;&#x1fe6;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&#x1f71;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>
marked with an asterisk. The other Vatican manuscripts and the
three Florentine contain only excerpts from the emperor's book. All
the titles of the excerpts nearly agree with that which Xylander
prefixed to his edition,

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: Markou Antôninou Autokratoros tôn eis heauton biblia ib.">&Mu;&#x1f71;&rho;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;

&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#x1f77;&alpha; &iota;&beta;.</ins>
 This title has been used by all subsequent editors. We cannot tell whether
Antoninus divided his work into books or somebody else did it. If
the inscriptions at the end of the first and second books are
genuine, he may have made the division himself.</p>

<p>It is plain that the emperor wrote down his thoughts or
reflections as the occasions arose; and since they were intended
for his own use, it is no improbable conjecture that he left a
complete copy behind him written with his own hand; for it is not
likely that so diligent a man would use the labor of a transcriber
for such a purpose, and expose his most secret thoughts to any
other eye. He may have also intended the book for his son Commodus,
who however had no taste for his father's philosophy. Some careful
hand preserved the precious volume; and a work by Antoninus is
mentioned by other late writers besides Suidas.</p>

<p>Many critics have labored on the text of Antoninus. The most
complete edition is that by Thomas Gataker, 1652, 4to. The second
edition of Gataker was superintended by George Stanhope, 1697, 4to.
There is also an edition of 1704. Gataker made and suggested many
good corrections, and he also made a new Latin version, which is
not a very good specimen of Latin, but it generally expresses the
sense of the original, and often better than some of the more
recent translations. He added in the margin opposite to each
paragraph references to the other parallel passages; and he wrote a
commentary, one of the most complete that has been written on any
ancient author. This commentary contains the editor's exposition of
the more difficult passages, and quotations from all the Greek and
Roman writers for the illustration of the text. It is a wonderful
monument of learning and labor, and certainly no Englishman has yet
done anything like it. At the end of his preface the editor says
that he wrote it at Rotherhithe near London, in a severe winter,
when he was in the seventy-eighth year of his age, 1651&mdash;a
time when Milton, Selden, and other great men of the Commonwealth
time were living; and the great French scholar Saumaise
(Salmasius), with whom Gataker corresponded and received help from
him for his edition of Antoninus. The Greek test has also been
edited by J. M. Schultz, Leipzig, 1802, 8vo; and by the learned
Greek Adamantinus Corais, Paris, 1816, 8vo. The text of Schultz was
republished by Tauchnitz, 1821.</p>

<p>There are English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish
translations of M. Antoninus, and there may be others. I have not
seen all the English translations. There is one by Jeremy Collier,
1702, 8vo, a most coarse and vulgar copy of the original. The
latest French translation by Alexis Pierron in the collection of
Charpentier is better than Dacier's, which has been honored with an
Italian version (Udine, 1772). There is an Italian version (1675),
which I have not seen. It is by a cardinal. "A man illustrious in
the church, the Cardinal Francis Barberini the elder, nephew of
Pope Urban VIII., occupied the last years of his life in
translating into his native language the thoughts of the Roman
emperor, in order to diffuse among the faithful the fertilizing and
vivifying seeds. He dedicated this translation to his soul, to make
it, as he says in his energetic style, redder than his purple at
the sight of the virtues of this Gentile" (Pierron, Preface).</p>

<p>I have made this translation at intervals after having used the
book for many years. It is made from the Greek, but I have not
always followed one text; and I have occasionally compared other
versions with my own. I made this translation for my own use,
because I found that it was worth the labor; but it may be useful
to others also; and therefore I determined to print it. As the
original is sometimes very difficult to understand and still more
difficult to translate, it is not possible that I have always
avoided error. But I believe that I have not often missed the
meaning, and those who will take the trouble to compare the
translation with the original should not hastily conclude that I am
wrong, if they do not agree with me. Some passages do give the
meaning, though at first sight they may not appear to do so; and
when I differ from the translators, I think that in some places
they are wrong, and in other places I am sure that they are. I have
placed in some passages a +, which indicates corruption in the text
or great uncertainty in the meaning. I could have made the language
more easy and flowing, but I have preferred a ruder style as being
better suited to express the character of the original; and
sometimes the obscurity which may appear in the version is a fair
copy of the obscurity of the Greek. If I should ever revise this
version, I would gladly make use of any corrections which may be
suggested. I have added an index of some of the Greek terms with
the corresponding English. If I have not given the best words for
the Greek, I have done the best that I could; and in the text I
have always given the same translation of the same word.</p>

<p>The last reflection of the Stoic philosophy that I have observed
is in Simplicius' Commentary on the Enchiridion of Epictetus.
Simplicius was not a Christian, and such a man was not likely to be
converted at a time when Christianity was grossly corrupted. But he
was a really religious man, and he concludes his commentary with a
prayer to the Deity which no Christian could improve. From the time
of Zeno to Simplicius, a period of about nine hundred years, the
Stoic philosophy formed the characters of some of the best and
greatest men. Finally it became extinct, and we hear no more of it
till the revival of letters in Italy. Angelo Poliziano met with two
very inaccurate and incomplete manuscripts of Epictetus'
Enchiridion, which he translated into Latin and dedicated to his
great patron Lorenzo de' Medici, in whose collection he had found
the book. Poliziano's version was printed in the first B&acirc;le
edition of the Enchiridion, A. D. 1531 (apud And. Cratandrum).
Poliziano recommends the Enchiridion to Lorenzo as a work well
suited to his temper, and useful in the difficulties by which he
was surrounded.</p>

<p>Epictetus and Antoninus have had readers ever since they were
first printed. The little book of Antoninus has been the companion
of some great men. Machiavelli's Art of War and Marcus Antoninus
were the two books which were used when he was a young man by
Captain John Smith, and he could not have found two writers better
fitted to form the character of a soldier and a man. Smith is
almost unknown and forgotten in England, his native country, but
not in America, where he saved the young colony of Virginia. He was
great in his heroic mind and his deeds in arms, but greater still
in the nobleness of his character. For a man's greatness lies not
in wealth and station, as the vulgar believe, nor yet in his
intellectual capacity, which is often associated with the meanest
moral character, the most abject servility to those in high places,
and arrogance to the poor and lowly; but a man's true greatness
lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose in life, founded on
a just estimate of himself and everything else, on frequent
self-examination, and a steady obedience to the rule which he knows
to be right, without troubling himself, as the emperor says he
should not, about what others may think or say, or whether they do
or do not do that which he thinks and says and does.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PHILOSOPHY" id="THE_PHILOSOPHY"></a>THE
PHILOSOPHY</h3>

<h3>OF</h3>

<h2>MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS.</h2>

<p>It has been said that the Stoic philosophy first showed its real
value when it passed from Greece to Rome. The doctrines of Zeno and
his successors were well suited to the gravity and practical good
sense of the Romans; and even in the Republican period we have an
example of a man, M. Cato Uticensis, who lived the life of a Stoic
and died consistently with the opinions which he professed. He was
a man, says Cicero, who embraced the Stoic philosophy from
conviction; not for the purpose of vain discussion, as most did,
but in order to make his life conformable to the Stoic precepts. In
the wretched times from the death of Augustus to the murder of
Domitian, there was nothing but the Stoic philosophy which could
console and support the followers of the old religion under
imperial tyranny and amidst universal corruption. There were even
then noble minds that could dare and endure, sustained by a good
conscience and an elevated idea of the purposes of man's existence.
Such were Paetus Thrasae, Helvidius Priscus, Cornutus, C. Musonius
Rufus,<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and the poets Persius and
Juvenal, whose energetic language and manly thoughts may be as
instructive to us now as they might have been to their
contemporaries. Persius died under Nero's bloody reign; but Juvenal
had the good fortune to survive the tyrant Domitian and to see the
better times of Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian.<a name="FNanchor_B_17"
id="FNanchor_B_17" /><a href="#Footnote_B_17" class=
"fnanchor">[B]</a> His best precepts are derived from the Stoic
school, and they are enforced in his finest verses by the
unrivalled vigor of the Latin language.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_16" id="Footnote_A_16" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_16">[A]</a> I have omitted
Seneca, Nero's preceptor. He was in a sense a Stoic, and he has
said many good things in a very fine way. There is a judgment of
Gellius (xii. 2.) on Seneca, or rather a statement of what some
people thought of his philosophy, and it is not favorable. His
writings and his life must be taken together, and I have nothing
more to say of him here. The reader will find a notice of Seneca
and his philosophy in "Seekers after God," by the Rev. P. W.
Farrar. Macmillan and Co.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_B_17" id="Footnote_B_17" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_B_17">[B]</a> Ribbeck has
labored to prove that those Satires, which contain philosophical
precepts, are not the work of the real, but of a false Juvenal, a
Declamator. Still the verses exist, and were written by somebody
who was acquainted with the Stoic doctrines.</p>
</div>

<p>The best two expounders of the later Stoical philosophy were a
Greek slave and a Roman emperor. Epictetus, a Phrygian Greek, was
brought to Rome, we know not how, but he was there the slave and
afterwards the freedman of an unworthy master, Epaphroditus by
name, himself a freedman and a favorite of Nero. Epictetus may have
been a hearer of C. Musonius Rufus, while he was still a slave, but
he could hardly have been a teacher before he was made free. He was
one of the philosophers whom Domitian's order banished from Rome.
He retired to Nicopolis in Epirus, and he may have died there. Like
other great teachers he wrote nothing, and we are indebted to his
grateful pupil Arrian for what we have of Epictetus' discourses.
Arrian wrote eight books of the discourses of Epictetus, of which
only four remain and some fragments. We have also from Arrian's
hand the small Enchiridion or Manual of the chief precepts of
Epictetus. This is a valuable commentary on the Enchiridion by
Simplicius, who lived in the time of the emperor Justinian.<a name=
"FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18" /><a href="#Footnote_A_18"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_18" id="Footnote_A_18" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_18">[A]</a> There is a
complete edition of Arrian's Epictetus with the commentary of
Simplicius by J. Schweighaeuser, 6 vols. 8vo. 1799, 1800. There is
also an English translation of Epictetus by Mrs. Carter.</p>
</div>

<p>Antoninus in his first book (<a href="#i._7">i. 7</a>), in
which he gratefully commemorates his obligations to his teachers,
says that he was made acquainted by Junius Rusticus with the
discourses of Epictetus, whom he mentions also in other passages
(<a href="#iv._41">iv. 41</a>; <a href="#xi._34">xi. 34</a>, <a
href="#xi._36">36</a>). Indeed, the doctrines of Epictetus and
Antoninus are the same, and Epictetus is the best authority for the
explanation of the philosophical language of Antoninus and the
exposition of his opinions. But the method of the two philosophers
is entirely different. Epictetus addressed himself to his hearers
in a continuous discourse and in a familiar and simple manner.
Antoninus wrote down his reflections for his own use only, in
short, unconnected paragraphs, which are often obscure.</p>

<p>The Stoics made three divisions of philosophy,&mdash;Physic

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: phusikon">(&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1f79;&nu;)</ins>, Ethic
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: êthikon">(&#x1f20;&theta;&iota;&kappa;&#x1f79;&nu;)</ins>, and Logic
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logikon">(&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1f79;&nu;)</ins> (<a href=
"#viii._13">viii. 13</a>). This division, we are told by Diogenes,
was made by Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic sect, and by
Chrysippus; but these philosophers placed the three divisions in
the following order,&mdash;Logic, Physic, Ethic. It appears,
however, that this division was made before Zeno's time, and
acknowledged by Plato, as Cicero remarks (Acad. Post. i. 5). Logic
is not synonymous with our term Logic in the narrower sense of that
word.</p>

<p>Cleanthes, a Stoic, subdivided the three divisions and made
six,&mdash;Dialectic and Rhetoric, comprised in Logic; Ethic and
Politic; Physic and Theology. This division was merely for
practical use, for all Philosophy is one. Even among the earliest
Stoics Logic, or Dialectic, does not occupy the same place as in
Plato: it is considered only as an instrument which is to be used
for the other divisions of Philosophy. An exposition of the earlier
Stoic doctrines and of their modifications would require a volume.
My object is to explain only the opinions of Antoninus, so far as
they can be collected from his book.</p>

<p>According to the subdivision of Cleanthes, Physic and Theology
go together, or the study of the nature of Things, and the study of
the nature of the Deity, so far as man can understand the Deity,
and of his government of the universe. This division or subdivision
is not formally adopted by Antoninus, for, as already observed,
there is no method in his book; but it is virtually contained in
it.</p>

<p>Cleanthes also connects Ethic and Politic, or the study of the
principles of morals and the study of the constitution of civil
society; and undoubtedly he did well in subdividing Ethic into two
parts. Ethic in the narrower sense and Politic; for though the two
are intimately connected, they are also very distinct, and many
questions can only be properly discussed by carefully observing the
distinction. Antoninus does not treat of Politic. His subject is
Ethic, and Ethic in its practical application to his own conduct in
life as a man and as a governor. His Ethic is founded on his
doctrines about man's nature, the Universal Nature, and the
relation of every man to everything else. It is therefore
intimately and inseparably connected with Physic, or the Nature of
Things, and with Theology, or the Nature of the Deity. He advises
us to examine well all the impressions on our minds

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: phantasiai">(&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1f77;&alpha;&iota;)</ins> and to
form a right judgment of them, to make just conclusions, and to
inquire into the meanings of words, and so far to apply Dialectic;
but he has no attempt at any exposition of Dialectic, and his
philosophy is in substance purely moral and practical. He says (<a
href="#viii._13">viii. 13</a>), "Constantly and, if it be
possible, on the occasion of every impression on the soul,<a name=
"FNanchor_A_19" id="FNanchor_A_19" /><a href="#Footnote_A_19"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> apply to it the principles of Physic, of
Ethic, and of Dialectic: "which is only another way of telling us
to examine the impression in every possible way. In another passage
(<a href="#iii._11">iii. 11</a>) he says, "To the aids which have
been mentioned, let this one still be added: make for thyself a
definition or description of the object

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to phantaston">(&tau;&#x1f78; &phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#x1f79;&nu;)</ins> which is
presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it
is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and
tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which
it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved." Such
an examination implies a use of Dialectic, which Antoninus
accordingly employed as a means toward establishing his Physical,
Theological, and Ethical principles.</p>

no word which expresses

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: phantasia">&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1f77;&alpha;</ins>,

for it is not only the sensuous appearance which comes from an external

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to phantaston">&tau;&#x1f78; &phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#x1f79;&nu;</ins>,

but it is also the thought or feeling or opinion which is produced even
when there is no corresponding external object before us. Accordingly
everything which moves the soul is

<p>In this extract Antoninus says

I have translated

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: pathologein">&pi;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1fd1;&nu;</ins>
by using the word Moral (Ethic), and that is the meaning here.</p>
</div>

<p>There are several expositions of the Physical, Theological, and
Ethical principles, which are contained in the work of Antoninus;
and more expositions than I have read. Ritter (Geschichte der
Philosophie, iv. 241), after explaining the doctrines of Epictetus,
treats very briefly and insufficiently those of Antoninus. But he
refers to a short essay, in which the work is done better.<a name=
"FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20" /><a href="#Footnote_A_20"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> There is also an essay on the
Philosophical Principles of M. Aurelius Antoninus by J.M. Schultz,
placed at the end of his German translation of Antoninus
(Schleswig, 1799). With the assistance of these two useful essays
and his own diligent study, a man may form a sufficient notion of
the principles of Antoninus; but he will find it more difficult to
expound them to others. Besides the want of arrangement in the
original and of connection among the numerous paragraphs, the
corruption of the text, the obscurity of the language and the
style, and sometimes perhaps the confusion in the writer's own
ideas&mdash;besides all this, there is occasionally an apparent
contradiction in the emperor's thoughts, as if his principles were
sometimes unsettled, as if doubt sometimes clouded his mind. A man
who leads a life of tranquillity and reflection, who is not
disturbed at home and meddles not with the affairs of the world,
may keep his mind at ease and his thoughts in one even course. But
such a man has not been tried. All his Ethical philosophy and his
passive virtue might turn out to be idle words, if he were once
exposed to the rude realities of human existence. Fine thoughts and
moral dissertations from men who have not worked and suffered may
be read, but they will be forgotten. No religion, no Ethical
philosophy is worth anything, if the teacher has not lived the
"life of an apostle," and been ready to die "the death of a
martyr." "Not in passivity (the passive effects) but in activity
lie the evil and the good of the rational social animal, just as
his virtue and his vice lie not in passivity, but in activity" (<a
href="#ix._16">ix. 16</a>). The emperor Antoninus was a practical
moralist. From his youth he followed a laborious discipline, and
though his high station placed him above all want or the fear of
it, he lived as frugally and temperately as the poorest philospher.
Epictetus wanted little, and it seems that he always had the little
that he wanted and he was content with it, as he had been with his
servile station! But Antoninus after his accession to the empire
sat on an uneasy seat. He had the administration of an empire which
extended from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, from the cold
mountains of Scotland to the hot sands of Africa; and we may
imagine, though we cannot know it by experience, what must be the
trials, the troubles, the anxiety, and the sorrows of him who has
the world's business on his hands, with the wish to do the best
that he can, and the certain knowledge that he can do very little
of the good which he wishes.</p>

</div>

<p>In the midst of war, pestilence, conspiracy, general corruption,
and with the weight of so unwieldy an empire upon him, we may
easily comprehend that Antoninus often had need of all his
fortitude to support him. The best and the bravest men have moments
of doubt and of weakness; but if they are the best and the bravest,
they rise again from their depression by recurring to first
principles, as Antoninus does. The emperor says that life is smoke,
a vapor, and St. James in his Epistle is of the same mind; that the
world is full of envious, jealous, malignant people, and a man
might be well content to get out of it. He has doubts perhaps
sometimes even about that to which he holds most firmly. There are
only a few passages of this kind, but they are evidence of the
struggles which even the noblest of the sons of men had to maintain
against the hard realities of his daily life. A poor remark it is
which I have seen somewhere, and made in a disparaging way, that
the emperor's reflections show that he had need of consolation and
comfort in life, and even to prepare him to meet his death. True
that he did need comfort and support, and we see how he found it.
He constantly recurs to his fundamental principle that the universe
is wisely ordered, that every man is a part of it and must conform
to that order which he cannot change, that whatever the Deity has
done is good, that all mankind are a man's brethren, that he must
love and cherish them and try to make them better, even those who
would do him harm. This is his conclusion (<a href="#ii._17">ii.
17</a>): "What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One
thing and only one, Philosophy. But this consists in keeping the
divinity within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to
pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a purpose nor yet
falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's
doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that
happens and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever
it is, from whence he himself came; and finally waiting for death
with a cheerful mind as being nothing else than a dissolution of
the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if
there is no harm, to the elements themselves in each continually
changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about
the change and dissolution of all the elements [himself]? for it is
according to nature; and nothing is evil that is according to
nature."</p>

<p>The Physic of Antoninus is the knowledge of the Nature of the
Universe, of its government, and of the relation of man's nature to
both. He names the universe <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hê tôn hylôn ousia">(&#x1f21; &tau;&#x1ff6;&nu;
&#x1f51;&lambda;&omega;&nu; &omicron;&#x3af;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;</ins> vi.
1),<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> "the universal
substance," and he adds that "reason "

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">
(&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</ins> governs the universe. He
also (<a href="#vi._9">vi. 9</a>) uses the terms "universal
nature" or "nature of the universe." He (<a href="#vi._25">vi.
25</a>) calls the universe "the one and all, which we name Cosmos
or Order"

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: kosmos">&kappa;&#x1f79;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</ins>. If he
ever seems to use these general terms as significant of the All, of
all that man can in any way conceive to exist, he still on other
occasions plainly distinguishes between Matter, Material things

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hylê, hylikon">(&#x1f55;&lambda;&eta;, &#x1f51;&lambda;&#x3af;&kappa;&#x3cc;&nu;)</ins>, and
Cause, Origin, Reason

This is conformable to Zeno's doctrine that there are two original
principles <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: archai">(&#x1f00;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&#x3af;)</ins> of all things, that
which acts <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to poioun">(&#x3c4;&#x1f78;
&pi;&omicron;&#x3af;&omicron;&#x1fe6;&nu;)</ins> and that which is acted
upon <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to paschon">(&tau;&#x1f78; &pi;&#x3ac;&sigma;&chi;&omicron;&nu;)</ins>. That
which is acted on is the formless matter <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hylê">(&#x1f55;&lambda;&eta;)</ins>:
that which acts is the reason
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">(&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>), God, who is eternal and
operates through all matter, and produces all things. So Antoninus
(<a href="#v._32">v. 32</a>) speaks of the reason
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">(&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</ins> which pervades all
substance <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ousia">(&omicron;&#x1f50;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;)</ins>, and through all
time by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the universe
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to pan">(&tau;&#x1f78; &pi;&#x1fb6;&nu;</ins>). God is eternal, and Matter is
eternal. It is God who gives form to matter, but he is not said to
have created matter. According to this view, which is as old as
Anaxagoras, God and matter exist independently, but God governs
matter. This doctrine is simply the expression of the fact of the
existence both of matter and of God. The Stoics did not perplex
themselves with the in-soluble question of the origin and nature of
matter.<a name="FNanchor_C_23" id="FNanchor_C_23" /><a href=
"#Footnote_C_23" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Antoninus also assumes a
beginning of things, as we now know them; but his language is
sometimes very obscure. I have endeavored to explain the meaning of
one difficult passage (<a href="#vii._75">vii. 75</a>, and the

 title="Greek: hê sumpasa ousia">&#x1f21; &sigma;&upsilon;&mu;&pi;&#x1fb6;&sigma;&alpha;
&omicron;&#x1f50;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;</ins>, "the universal substance." He
says (<a href="#xii._30">xii. 30</a> and <a href="#iv._40">iv.
40</a>), "there is one common substance"
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ousia">&omicron;&#x1f50;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;</ins>, distributed among countless
bodies. In Stobaeus (tom. 1, lib. 1, tit. 14) there is this
definition, <ins class="greek"

<ins class="greek"

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ousia">&omicron;&#x1f50;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;</ins> is the generic name of that
existence which we assume as the highest or ultimate, because we
conceive no existence which can be coordinated with it and none
above it. It is the philosopher's "substance:" it is the ultimate
expression for that which we conceive or suppose to be the basis,
the being of a thing. "From the Divine, which is substance in
itself, or the only and sole substance, all and everything that is
created exists" (Swedenborg, Angelic Wisdom, 198).</p>

"#FNanchor_B_22">[B]</a> I remark, in
order to anticipate any misapprehension, that all these general
terms involve a contradiction. The "one and all," and the like, and
"the whole," imply limitation. "One" is limited; "all" is limited;
the "whole" is limited. We cannot help it. We cannot find words to
express that which we cannot fully conceive. The addition of
"absolute" or any other such word does not mend the matter. Even
the word God is used by most people, often unconsciously, in such a
way that limitation is implied, and yet at the same time words are
added which are intended to deny limitation. A Christian martyr,
when he was asked what God was, is said to have answered that God
has no name like a man; and Justin says the same (Apol. ii. 6),
"the names Father, God, Creator, Lord, and Master are not names,
but appellations derived from benefactions and acts." (Compare
Seneca, De Benef. iv. 8.) We can conceive the existence of a thing,
or rather we may have the idea of an existence, without an adequate
notion of it, "adequate" meaning coextensive and coequal with the
thing. We have a notion of limited space derived from the
dimensions of what we call a material thing, though of space
absolute, if I may use the term, we have no notion at all; and of
infinite space the notion is the same&mdash;no notion at all; and
yet we conceive it in a sense, though I know not how, and we
believe that space is infinite, and we cannot conceive it to be
finite.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_C_23" id="Footnote_C_23" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_C_23">[C]</a> The notions of
matter and of space are inseparable. We derive the notion of space
from matter and form. But we have no adequate conception either of
matter or space. Matter in its ultimate resolution is as
unintelligible as what men call mind, spirit, or by whatever other
name they may express the power which makes itself known by acts.
Anaxagoras laid down the distinction between intelligence
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: nous">(&nu;&omicron;&#x3cb;&sigmaf;</ins>) and matter, and he said that
intelligence impressed motion on matter, and so separated the
elements of matter and gave them order; but he probably only
assumed a beginning, as Simplicius says, as a foundation of his
philosophical teaching. Empedocles said, "The universe always
existed." He had no idea of what is called creation. Ocellus
Lucanus (i, &sect; 2) maintained that the Universe <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to pan">(&tau;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&nu;</ins>) was imperishable and uncreated. Consequently it is
eternal. He admitted the existence of God; but his theology would
require some discussion. On the contrary, the Brachmans, according
to Strabo (p. 713, ed. Cas.), taught that the universe was created
and perishable; and the creator and administrator of it pervades
the whole. The author of the book of Solomon's Wisdom says (xi.
17): "Thy Almighty hand made the world of matter without form,"
which may mean that matter existed already.</p>

<p>The common Greek word which we translate "matter" is
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hylê">&#x3cb;&lambda;&eta;</ins>. It is the stuff that things are made of.</p>
</div>

<p>Matter consists of elemental parts
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: stoicheia">(&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&#x3af;&chi;&epsilon;&#x1fd6;&alpha;</ins>) of which
all material objects are made. But nothing is permanent in form.
The nature of the universe, according to Antoninus' expression (<a
href="#iv._36">iv. 36</a>), "loves nothing so much as to change
the things which are, and to make new things like them. For
everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will
be. But thou art thinking only of seeds which are cast into the
earth or into a womb: but this is a very vulgar notion." All things
then are in a constant flux and change; some things are dissolved
into the elements, others come in their places; and so the "whole
universe continues ever young and perfect" (<a href=
"#xii._23">xii. 23</a>).</p>

<p>Antoninus has some obscure expressions about what he calls
"seminal principles"
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: spermatikoi logoi">(&sigma;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&#x3af;&kappa;&omicron;&#x1f76;
&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&#x3af;</ins>). He opposes them to the
Epicurean atoms (<a href="#vi._24">vi. 24</a>), and consequently
his "seminal principles" are not material atoms which wander about
at hazard, and combine nobody knows how. In one passage (<a href=
"#iv._21">iv. 21</a>) he speaks of living principles, souls
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: psychai">(&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&alpha;&#x1f76;</ins>) after the dissolution of their
bodies being received into the "seminal principle of the universe."
Schultz thinks that by "seminal principles Antoninus means the
relations of the various elemental principles, which relations are
determined by the Deity and by which alone the production of
organized beings is possible." This may be the meaning; but if it
is, nothing of any value can be derived from it.<a name=
"FNanchor_A_24" id="FNanchor_A_24" /><a href="#Footnote_A_24"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Antoninus often uses the word "Nature"
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: physis">(&phi;&#x3cd;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</ins>), and we must attempt to fix its
meaning, The simple etymological sense of
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: physis">&phi;&#x3cd;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</ins> is "production," the birth of what
we call Things. The Romans used Natura, which also means "birth"
originally. But neither the Greeks nor the Romans stuck to this
simple meaning, nor do we. Antoninus says (<a href="#x._6">x.
6</a>): "Whether the universe is [a concourse of] atoms or Nature
[is a system], let this first be established, that I am a part of
the whole which is governed by nature." Here it might seem as if
nature were personified and viewed as an active, efficient power;
as something which, it not independent of the Deity, acts by a
power which is given to it by the Deity. Such, if I understand the
expression right, is the way in which the word Nature is often used
now, though it is plain that many writers use the word without
fixing any exact meaning to it. It is the same with the expression
Laws of Nature, which some writers may use in an intelligible
sense, but others as clearly use in no definite sense at all. There
is no meaning in this word Nature, except that which Bishop Butler
assigns to it, when he says, "The only distinct meaning of that
word Natural is Stated, Fixed, or Settled; since what is natural as
much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so,
<i>i.e.</i>, to effect it continually or at stated times, as what
is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it at once." This is
Plato's meaning (De Leg., iv. 715) when he says that God holds the
beginning and end and middle of all that exists, and proceeds
straight on his course, making his circuit according to nature
(that is by a fixed order); and he is continually accompanied by
justice, who punishes those who deviate from the divine law, that
is, from the order or course which God observes.</p>

<p>When we look at the motions of the planets, the action of what
we call gravitation, the elemental combination of unorganized
bodies and their resolution, the production of plants and of living
bodies, their generation, growth, and their dissolution, which we
call their death, we observe a regular sequence of phenomena, which
within the limits of experience present and past, so far as we know
the past, is fixed and invariable. But if this is not so, if the
order and sequence of phenomena, as known to us, are subject to
change in the course of an infinite progression,&mdash;and such
change is conceivable,&mdash;we have not discovered, nor shall we
ever discover, the whole of the order and sequence of phenomena, in
which sequence there may be involved according to its very nature,
that is, according to its fixed order, some variation of what we
now call the Order or Nature of Things. It is also conceivable that
such changes have taken place,&mdash;changes in the order of
things, as we are compelled by the imperfection of language to call
them, but which are no changes; and further it is certain that our
knowledge of the true sequence of all actual phenomena, as for
instance the phenomena of generation, growth, and dissolution, is
and ever must be imperfect.</p>

<p>We do not fare much better when we speak of Causes and Effects
than when we speak of Nature. For the practical purposes of life we
may use the terms cause and effect conveniently, and we may fix a
distinct meaning to them, distinct enough at least to prevent all
misunderstanding. But the case is different when we speak of causes
and effects as of Things. All that we know is phenomena, as the
Greeks called them, or appearances which follow one another in a
regular order, as we conceive it, so that if some one phenomenon
should fail in the series, we conceive that there must either be an
interruption of the series, or that something else will appear
after the phenomenon which has failed to appear, and will occupy
the vacant place; and so the series in its progression may be
modified or totally changed. Cause and effect then mean nothing in
the sequence of natural phenomena beyond what I have said; and the
real cause, or the transcendent cause, as some would call it, of
each successive phenomenon is in that which is the cause of all
things which are, which have been, and which will be forever. Thus
the word Creation may have a real sense if we consider it as the
first, if we can conceive a first, in the present order of natural
phenomena; but in the vulgar sense a creation of all things at a
certain time, followed by a quiescence of the first cause and an
abandonment of all sequences of Phenomena to the laws of Nature, or
to the other words that people may Use, is absolutely absurd.<a

are the conditions of our thought; but time infinite and space
infinite cannot be objects of thought, except in a very imperfect
way. Time and space must not in any way be thought of when we think
of the Deity. Swedenborg says, "The natural man may believe that he
would have no thought, if the ideas of time, of space, and of
things material were taken away; for upon those is founded all the
thought that man has. But let him know that the thoughts are
limited and confined in proportion as they partake of time, of
space, and of what is material; and that they are not limited and
are extended, in proportion as they do not partake of those things;
since the mind is so far elevated above the things corporeal and
worldly" (Concerning Heaven and Hell, 169).</p>

<p>Now, though there is great difficulty in understanding all the
passages of Antoninus, in which he speaks of Nature, of the changes
of things and of the economy of the universe, I am convinced that
his sense of Nature and Natural is the same as that which I have
stated; and as he was a man who knew how to use words in a clear
way and with strict consistency, we ought to assume, even if his
meaning in some passages is doubtful, that his view of Nature was
in harmony with his fixed belief in the all-pervading, ever
present, and ever active energy of God. (<a href="#ii._4">ii.
4</a>; <a href="#iv._40">iv. 40</a>; <a href="#x._1">x. 1</a>; <a
href="#vi._40">vi. 40</a>; and other passages. Compare Seneca, De
Benef., iv. 7. Swedenborg, Angelic Wisdom, 349-357.)</p>

<p>There is much in Antoninus that is hard to understand, and it
might be said that he did not fully comprehend all that he wrote;
which would however be in no way remarkable, for it happens now
that a man may write what neither he nor anybody can understand.
Antoninus tells us (<a href="#xii._10">xii. 10</a>) to look at
things and see what they are, resolving them into the material
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hylê">(&#x1f55;&lambda;&eta;)</ins> , the casual
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aition">(&alpha;&#x1f32;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&nu;)</ins>, and the relation
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: anaphora">(&#x1f00;&nu;&alpha;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&#x3ac;)</ins>, or the purpose, by
which he seems to mean something in the nature of what we call
effect, or end. The word Cause <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aitia">(&alpha;&#x1f30;&tau;&#x3af;&alpha;)</ins> is
the difficulty. There is the same word in the Sanscrit
(<i>hétu</i>); and the subtle philosophers of India and of Greece,
and the less subtle philosophers of modern times, have all used
this word, or an equivalent word, in a vague way. Yet the confusion
sometimes may be in the inevitable ambiguity of language rather
than in the mind of the writer, for I cannot think that some of the
wisest of men did not know what they intended to say. When
Antoninus says (<a href="#iv._36">iv. 36</a>), "that everything
that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be," he
might be supposed to say what some of the Indian philosophers have
said, and thus a profound truth might be converted into a gross
absurdity. But he says, "in a manner," and in a manner he said
true; and in another manner, if you mistake his meaning, he said
false. When Plato said, "Nothing ever is, but is always becoming"
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aei gignetai">(&#x1f00;&epsilon;&#x1f76;
&gamma;&#x3af;&gamma;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</ins>), he delivered
a text, out of which we may derive something; for he destroys by it
not all practical, but all speculative notions of cause and effect.
The whole series of things, as they appear to us, must be
contemplated in time, that is in succession, and we conceive or
suppose intervals between one state of things and another state of
things, so that there is priority and sequence, and interval, and
Being, and a ceasing to Be, and beginning and ending. But there is
nothing of the kind in the Nature of Things. It is an everlasting
continuity (<a href="#iv._34">iv. 45</a>; <a href="#vii._75">vii.
75</a>). When Antoninus speaks of generation (<a href="#x._26">x.
26</a>), he speaks of one cause <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aitia">(&alpha;&#x1f30;&tau;&#x3af;&alpha;)</ins>
acting, and then another cause taking up the work, which the former
left in a certain state, and so on; and we might perhaps conceive
that he had some notion like what has been called "the
self-evolving power of nature;" a fine phrase indeed, the full
import of which I believe that the writer of it did not see, and
thus he laid himself open to the imputation of being a follower of
one of the Hindu sects, which makes all things come by evolution
out of nature or matter, or out of something which takes the place
of Deity, but is not Deity. I would have all men think as they
please, or as they can, and I only claim the same freedom which I
give. When a man writes anything, we may fairly try to find out all
that his words must mean, even if the result is that they mean what
he did not mean; and if we find this contradiction, it is not our
fault, but his misfortune. Now Antoninus is perhaps somewhat in
this condition in what he says (<a href="#x._26">x. 26</a>),
though he speaks at the end of the paragraph of the power which
acts, unseen by the eyes, but still no less clearly. But whether in
this passage (<a href="#x._26">x. 26</a>) lie means that the power
is conceived to be in the different successive causes
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aitiai">(&alpha;&#x1f30;&tau;&#x3af;&alpha;&iota;)</ins>, or in something else,
nobody can tell. From other passages, however, I do collect that
his notion of the phenomena of the universe is what I have stated.
The Deity works unseen, if we may use such language, and perhaps I
may, as Job did, or he who wrote the book of Job. "In him we live
and move and are," said St. Paul to the Athenians; and to show his
hearers that this was no new doctrine, he quoted the Greek poets.
One of these poets was the Stoic Cleauthes, whose noble hymn to
Zeus, or God, is an elevated expression of devotion and philosophy.
It deprives Nature of her power, and puts her under the immediate
government of the Deity.</p>

<div class="poem p">
<p>"Thee all this heaven, which whirls around the earth,<br />
Obeys, and willing follows where thou leadest.<br />
Without thee, God, nothing is done on earth,<br />
Nor in the ethereal realms, nor in the sea,<br />
Save what the wicked through their folly do."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Antoninus' conviction of the existence of a divine power and
government was founded on his perception of the order of the
universe. Like Socrates (Xen. Mem., iv. 3, 13, etc.) he says that
though we cannot see the forms of divine powers, we know that they
exist because we see their works.</p>

<p>"To those who ask, Where hast thou seen the gods, or how dost
thou comprehend that they exist and so worshipest them? I answer,
in the first place, that they may be seen even with the eyes; in
the second place, neither have I seen my own soul, and yet I honor
it. Thus then with respect to the gods, from what I constantly
experience of their power, from this I comprehend that they exist,
and I venerate them." (<a href="#xii._28">xii. 28</a>, and the
note. Comp. Aristotle de Mundo, c. 6; Xen. Mem. i. 4, 9; Cicero,
Tuscul. i. 28, 29; St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, i. 19, 20; and
Montaigne's Apology for Raimond de Sebonde, ii. c. 12.) This is a
very old argument, which has always had great weight with most
people, and has appeared sufficient. It does not acquire the least
additional strength by being developed in a learned treatise. It is
as intelligible in its simple enunciation as it can be made. If it
is rejected, there is no arguing with him who rejects it: and if it
is worked out into innumerable particulars, the value of the
evidence runs the risk of being buried under a mass of words.</p>

<p>Man being conscious that he is a spiritual power, or that he has
such a power, in whatever way he conceives that he has it&mdash;for
I wish simply to state a fact&mdash;from this power which he has in
himself, he is led, as Antoninus says, to believe that there is a
greater power, which, as the old Stoics tell us, pervades the whole
universe as the intellect<a name="FNanchor_A_26" id=

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_26" id="Footnote_A_26" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_26">[A]</a> I have always
translated the word <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: nous">&nu;&omicron;&#x1fe6;&sigmaf;</ins>, "intelligence" or
"intellect." It appears to be the word used by the oldest Greek
philosophers to express the notion of "intelligence" as opposed to
the notion of "matter." I have always translated the word
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins> by "reason," and
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logikos">&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#x3cc;&sigmaf;</ins> by the word
"rational," or perhaps sometimes "reasonable," as I have translated
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: noeros">&nu;&omicron;&epsilon;&rho;&#x3cc;&sigmaf;</ins> by the word
"intellectual." Every man who has thought and has read any
philosophical writings knows the difficulty of finding words to
express certain notions, how imperfectly
words express these notions,
and how carelessly the words are often used. The various senses of
the word <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins> are enough to
perplex any man. Our translators of the New Testament (St. John, c.
1.) have simply translated <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ho logos">&#x1f41; &lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins> by "the word," as the
Germans translated it by "das Wort;" but in their theological
writings they sometimes retain the original term Logos. The Germans
have a term Vernunft, which seems to come nearest to our word
Reason, or the necessary and absolute truths which we cannot
conceive as being other than what they are. Such are what some
people have called the laws of thought, the conceptions of space
and of time, and axioms or first principles, which need no proof
and cannot be proved or denied. Accordingly the Germans can say,
"Gott ist die h&ouml;chste Vernunft," the Supreme Reason. The
Germans have also a word Verstand, which seems to represent our
word "understanding," "intelligence," "intellect," not as a thing
absolute which exists by itself, but as a thing connected with an
individual being, as a man. Accordingly it is the capacity of
receiving impressions (Vorstellungen,
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: phantasiai">&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#x3af;&alpha;&iota;)</ins>, and
forming from them distinct ideas (Begriffe), and perceiving
differences. I do not think that these remarks will help the reader
to theunderstanding of Antoninus, or his use of the words
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: nous">&nu;&omicron;&#x1fe6;&sigmaf;</ins> and
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: logos">&lambda;&#x3cc;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</ins>. The emperor's meaning must
be got from his own words, and if it does not agree altogether with
modern notions, it is not our business to force it into agreement,
but simply to find out what his meaning is, if we can.</p>

<p>Justinus (ad Diognetum, c. vii.) says that the omnipotent,
all-creating, and invisible God has fixed truth and the holy,
incomprehensible Logos in men's hearts; and this Logos is the
architect and creator of the Universe. In the first Apology (c.
xxxii.), he says that the seed <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: sperma">(&sigma;&pi;&#x3ad;&rho;&mu;&alpha;</ins>)
from God is the Logos, which dwells in those who believe in God. So
it appears that according to Justinus the Logos is only in such
believers. In the second Apology (c. viii.) he speaks of the seed
of the Logos being implanted in all mankind; but those who order
their lives according to Logos, such as the Stoics, have only a
portion of the Logos <ins class="greek"

<p>God exists then, but what do we know of his nature? Antoninus
says that the soul of man is an efflux from the divinity. We have
bodies like animals, but we have reason, intelligence, as the gods.
Animals have life <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: psychê">(&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#x3ae;)</ins> and what we call
instincts or natural principles of action: but the rational animal
man alone has a rational, intelligent soul
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: psychê logikê noera">(&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#x1f74; &lambda;&omicron;&iota;&kappa;&#x3ae;,
&upsilon;&omicron;&epsilon;&rho;&#x3ac;)</ins>. Antoninus insists on this
continually: God is in man,<a name="FNanchor_A_27" id=
"FNanchor_A_27" /><a href="#Footnote_A_27" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
and so we must constantly attend to the divinity within us, for it
is only in this way that we can have any knowledge of the nature of
God. The human soul is in a sense a portion of the divinity, and
the soul alone has any communication with the Deity; for as he says
(<a href="#xii._2">xii. 2</a>): "With his intellectual part alone
God touches the intelligence only which has flowed and been derived
from himself into these bodies." In fact he says that which is
hidden within a man is life, that is, the man himself. All the rest
is vesture, covering, organs, instrument, which the living man, the
real<a name="FNanchor_B_28" id="FNanchor_B_28" /><a href=
"#Footnote_B_28" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> man, uses for the purpose
of his present existence. The air is universally diffused for him
who is able to respire; and so for him who is willing to partake of
it the intelligent power, which holds within it all things, is
diffused as wide and free as the air (<a href="#viii._54">viii.
54</a>). It is by living a divine life that man approaches to a
knowledge of the divinity.<a name="FNanchor_C_29" id=
"FNanchor_C_29" /><a href="#Footnote_C_29" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
It is by following the divinity within
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: daimôn">&delta;&alpha;&#x3af;&mu;&omega;&nu;</ins> or
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: theos">&theta;&epsilon;&#x3cc;&sigmaf;</ins>, as Antonius calls it, that man
comes nearest to the Deity, the supreme good; for man can never
attain to perfect agreement with his internal guide (&tau;&omicron;
&#x3ae;&gamma;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#x3cc;&nu;).
"Live with the gods. And he does live with the gods who constantly
shows to them that his own soul is satisfied with that which is
assigned to him, and that it does all the daemon
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: daimôn">(&delta;&alpha;&#x3af;&mu;&omega;&nu;)</ins> wishes, which Zeus hath given
to every man for his guardian and guide, a portion of himself. And
this daemon is every man's understanding and reason" (<a href=

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_B_28" id="Footnote_B_28" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_B_28">[B]</a> This is also
Swedenborg's doctrine of the soul. "As to what concerns the soul,
of which it is said that it shall live after death, it is nothing
else but the man himself, who lives in the body, that is, the
interior man, who by the body acts in the world and from whom the
body itself lives" (quoted by Clissold, p. 456 of "The Practical
Nature of the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, in a
Letter to the Archbishop of Dublin (Whately)," second edition,
1859; a book which theologians might read with profit). This is an
old doctrine of the soul, which has been often proclaimed, but
never better expressed than by the "Auctor de Mundo," c. 6, quoted
by Gataker in his "Antoninus," p. 436. "The soul by which we live
and have cities and houses is invisible, but it is seen by its
works; for the whole method of life has been devised by it and
ordered, and by it is held together. In like manner we must think
also about the Deity, who in power is most mighty, in beauty most
comely, in life immortal, and in virtue supreme: wherefore though
he is invisible to human nature, he is seen by his very works."
Other passages to the same purpose are quoted by Gataker (p. 382).
Bishop Butler has the same as to the soul: "Upon the whole, then,
our organs of sense and our limbs are certainly instruments, which
the living persons, ourselves, make use of to perceive and move
with." If this is not plain enough, be also says: "It follows that
our organized bodies are no more ourselves, or part of ourselves,
than any other matter around us." (Compare Anton, x. 38).</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_C_29" id="Footnote_C_29" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_C_29">[C]</a> The reader may
consult Discourse V., "Of the existence and nature of God," in John
Smith's "Select Discourses." He has prefixed as a text to this
Discourse, the striking passage of Agapetus, Paraenes. &sect; 3:
"He who knows himself will know God; and he who knows God will be
made like to God; and he will be made like to God, who has become
worthy of God; and he becomes worthy of God, who does nothing
unworthy of God, but thinks the things that are his, and speaks
what he thinks, and does what he speaks." I suppose that the old
saying, "Know thyself," which is attributed to Socrates and others,
had a larger meaning than the narrow sense which is generally given
to it. (Agapetus, ed. Stephan. Schoning, Franeker, 1608. This
volume contains also the Paraeneses of Nilus.)</p>
</div>

<p>There is in man, that is in the reason, the intelligence, a
superior faculty which if it is exercised rules all the rest. This
is the ruling faculty <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: to hêgemonikon">(&tau;&#x1f78;
&#x1f21;&gamma;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#x3cc;&nu;)</ins>,
which Cicero (De Natura Deorum, ii. 11) renders by the Latin word
Principatus, "to which nothing can or ought to be superior."
Antoninus often uses this term and others which are equivalent. He
names it (<a href="#vii._64">vii. 64</a>) "the governing
intelligence." The governing faculty is the master of the soul (<a
href="#v._26">v. 26</a>). A man must reverence only his ruling
faculty and the divinity within him. As we must reverence that
which is supreme in the universe, so we must reverence that which
is supreme in ourselves; and this is that which is of like kind
with that which is supreme in the universe (<a href="#v._21">v.
21</a>). So, as Plotinus says, the soul of man can only know the
divine so far as it knows itself. In one passage (<a href=
"#xi._19">xi. 19</a>) Antoninus speaks of a man's condemnation of
himself when the diviner part within him has been overpowered and
yields to the less honorable and to the perishable part, the body,
and its gross pleasures. In a word, the views of Antoninus on this
matter, however his expressions may vary, are exactly what Bishop
Butler expresses when he speaks of "the natural supremacy of
reflection or conscience," of the faculty "which surveys, approves,
or disapproves the several affections of our mind and actions of
our lives."</p>

<p>Much matter might be collected from Antoninus on the notion of
the Universe being one animated Being. But all that he says amounts
to no more, as Schultz remarks, than this: the soul of man is most
intimately united to his body, and together they make one animal,
which we call man; so the Deity is most intimately united to the
world, or the material universe, and together they form one whole.
But Antoninus did not view God and the material universe as the
same, any more than he viewed the body and soul of man as one.
Antoninus has 110 speculations on the absolute nature of the Deity.
It was not his fashion to waste his time on what man cannot
understand.<a name="FNanchor_A_30" id="FNanchor_A_30" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_30" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> He was satisfied that God
exists, that he governs all things, that man can only have an
imperfect knowledge of his nature, and he must attain this
imperfect knowledge by reverencing the divinity which is within
him, and keeping it pure.</p>

</div>

<p>From all that has been said, it follows that the universe is
administered by the Providence of God
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: pronoia">(&pi;&rho;&#x3cc;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;)</ins>, and that all things
are wisely ordered. There are passages in which Antoninus expresses
doubts, or states different possible theories of the constitution
and government of the universe; but he always recurs to his
fundamental principle, that if we admit the existence of a deity,
we must also admit that he orders all things wisely and well (<a
href="#iv._27">iv. 27</a>; <a href="#vi._1">vi. 1</a>; <a href=
"#ix._28">ix. 28</a>; <a href="#xii._5">xii. 5</a>; and many
other passages). Epictetus says (i. 6) that we can discern the
providence which rules the world, if we possess two
things,&mdash;the power of seeing all that happens with respect to
each thing, and a grateful disposition.</p>

<p>But if all things are wisely ordered, how is the world so full
of what we call evil, physical and moral? If instead of saying that
there is evil in the world, we use the expression which I have
used, "what we call evil," we have partly anticipated the emperor's
answer. We see and feel and know imperfectly very few things in the
few years that we live, and all the knowledge and all the
experience of all the human race is positive ignorance of the
whole, which is infinite. Now, as our reason teaches us that
everything is in some way related to and connected with every other
thing, all notion of evil as being in the universe of things is a
contradiction; for if the whole comes from and is governed by an
intelligent being, it is impossible to conceive anything in it
which tends to the evil or destruction of the whole (<a href=
"#viii._55">viii. 55</a>; <a href="#x._6">x. 6</a>). Everything
is in constant mutation, and yet the whole subsists; we might
imagine the solar system resolved into its elemental parts, and yet
the whole would still subsist "ever young and perfect."</p>

<p>All things, all forms, are dissolved, and new forms appear. All
living things undergo the change which we call death. If we call
death an evil, then all change is an evil. Living beings also
suffer pain, and man suffers most of all, for he suffers both in
and by his body and by his intelligent part. Men suffer also from
one another, and perhaps the largest part of human suffering comes
to man from those whom he calls his brothers. Antoninus says (<a
href="#viii._55">viii. 55</a>), "Generally, wickedness does no
harm at all to the universe; and particularly, the wickedness [of
one man] does no harm to another. It is only harmful to him who has
it in his power to be released from it as soon as he shall choose."
The first part of this is perfectly consistent with the doctrine
that the whole can sustain no evil or harm. The second part must be
explained by the Stoic principle that there is no evil in anything
which is not in our power. What wrong we suffer from another is his
evil, not ours. But this is an admission that there is evil in a
sort, for he who does wrong does evil, and if others can endure the
wrong, still there is evil in the wrong-doer. Antoninus (<a href=
"#xi._18">xi. 18</a>) gives many excellent precepts with respect
to wrongs and injuries, and his precepts are practical. He teaches
us to bear what we cannot avoid, and his lessons may be just as
useful to him who denies the being and the government of God as to
him who believes in both. There is no direct answer in Antoninus to
the objections which may be made to the existence and providence of
God because of the moral disorder and suffering which are in the
world, except this answer which he makes in reply to the
supposition that even the best men may be extinguished by death. He
says if it is so, we may be sure that if it ought to have been
otherwise, the gods would have ordered it otherwise (<a href=
"#xii._5">xii. 5</a>). His conviction of the wisdom which we may
observe in the government of the world is too strong to be
disturbed by any apparent irregularities in the order of things.
That these disorders exist is a fact, and those who would conclude
from them against the being and government of God conclude too
hastily. We all admit that there is an order in the material world,
a Nature, in the sense in which that word has been explained, a
constitution
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: kataskeuê">(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;&upsilon;&#x3ae;)</ins>,
what we call a system, a relation of parts to one another and a
fitness of the whole for something. So in the constitution of
plants and of animals there is an order, a fitness for some end.
Sometimes the order, as we conceive it, is interrupted, and the
end, as we conceive it, is not attained. The seed, the plant, or
the animal sometimes perishes before it has passed through all its
changes and done all its uses. It is according to Nature, that is a
fixed order, for some to perish early and for others to do all
their uses and leave successors to take their place. So man has a
corporeal and intellectual and moral constitution fit for certain
uses, and on the whole man performs these uses, dies, and leaves
other men in his place. So society exists, and a social state is
manifestly the natural state of man&mdash;the state for which his
nature fits him, and society amidst innumerable irregularities and
disorders still subsists; and perhaps we may say that the history
of the past and our present knowledge give us a reasonable hope
that its disorders will diminish, and that order, its governing
principle, may be more firmly established. As order then, a fixed
order, we may say, subject to deviations real or apparent, must be
admitted to exist in the whole nature of things, that which we call
disorder or evil, as it seems to us, does not in any way alter the
fact of the general constitution of things having a nature or fixed
order. Nobody will conclude from the existence of disorder that
order is not the rule, for the existence of order both physical and
moral is proved by daily experience and all past experience. We
cannot conceive how the order of the universe is maintained: we
cannot even conceive how our own life from day to day is continued,
nor how we perform the simplest movements of the body, nor how we
grow and think and act, though we know many of the conditions which
are necessary for all these functions. Knowing nothing then of the
unseen power which acts in ourselves except by what is done, we
know nothing of the power which acts through what we call all time
and all space; but seeing that there is a nature or fixed order in
all things known to us, it is conformable to the nature of our
minds to believe that this universal Nature has a cause which
operates continually, and that we are totally unable to speculate
on the reason of any of those disorders or evils which we perceive.
This I believe is the answer which may be collected from all that
Antoninus has said.<a name="FNanchor_A_31" id="FNanchor_A_31" /><a

<p>The origin of evil is an old question. Achilles tells Priam
(Iliad, 24, 527) that Zeus has two casks, one filled with good
things, and the other with bad, and that he gives to men out of
each according to his pleasure; and so we must be content, for we
cannot alter the will of Zeus. One of the Greek commentators asks
how must we reconcile this doctrine with what we find in the first
book of the Odyssey, where the king of the gods says, Men say that
evil comes to them from us, but they bring it on themselves through
their own folly. The answer is plain enough even to the Greek
commentator. The poets make both Achilles and Zeus speak
appropriately to their several characters. Indeed, Zeus says
plainly that men do attribute their sufferings to their gods, but
they do it falsely, for they are the cause of their own
sorrows.</p>

<p>Epictetus in his Enchiridion (c. 27) makes short work of the
question of evil. He says, "As a mark is not set up for the purpose
of missing it, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the
universe." This will appear obscure enough to those who are not
acquainted with Epictetus, but he always knows what he is talking
about. We do not set up a mark in order to miss it, though we may
miss it. God, whose existence Epictetus assumes, has not ordered
all things so that his purpose shall fail. Whatever there may be of
what we call evil, the nature of evil, as he expresses it, does not
exist; that is, evil is not a part of the constitution or nature of
things. If there were a principle of evil <ins class="greek"
 title="archê">(&#x1f00;&rho;&chi;&#x3ae;)</ins>
in the constitution of things, evil would no longer be evil, as
Simplicius argues, but evil would be good. Simplicius (c. 34, [27])
has a long and curious discourse on this text of Epictetus, and it
is amusing and instructive.</p>

<p>One passage more will conclude this matter. It contains all that
the emperor could say (<a href="#ii._11">ii. 11</a>): "To go from
among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for
the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not
exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it
to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence?
But in truth they do exist, and they do care for human things, and
they have put all the means in man's power to enable him not to
fall into real evils. And as to the rest, if there was anything
evil, they would have provided for this also, that it should be
altogether in a man's power not to fall into it. But that which
does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But
neither through ignorance, nor having the knowledge but not the
power to guard against or correct these things, is it possible that
the nature of the universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible
that it has made so great a mistake, either through want of power
or want of skill, that good and evil should happen indiscriminately
to the good and the bad. But death certainly and life, honor and
dishonor, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to
good and bad men, being things which make us neither better nor
worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil."</p>

<p>The Ethical part of Antoninus' Philosophy follows from his
general principles. The end of all his philosophy is to live
conformably to Nature, both a man's own nature and the nature of
the universe. Bishop Butler has explained what the Greek
philosophers meant when they spoke of living according to Nature,
and he says that when it is explained, as he has explained it and
as they understood it, it is "a manner of speaking not loose and
undeterminate, but clear and distinct, strictly just and true." To
live according to Nature is to live according to a man's whole
nature, not according to a part of it, and to reverence the
divinity within him as the governor of all his actions. "To the
rational animal the same act is according to nature and according
to reason"<a name="FNanchor_A_32" id="FNanchor_A_32" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_32" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> (<a href="#vii._11">vii.
11</a>). That which is done contrary to reason is also an act
contrary to nature, to the whole nature, though it is certainly
conformable to some part of man's nature, or it could not be done.
Man is made for action, not for idleness or pleasure. As plants and
animals do the uses of their nature, so man must do his (<a href=
"#v._1">v. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_32" id="Footnote_A_32" /><a href=

Juvenal means when he says (xiv. 321),&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Nunquam aliud Natura aliud Sapientia dicit."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Man must also live conformably to the universal nature,
conformably to the nature of all things of which he is one; and as
a citizen of a political community he must direct his life and
actions with reference to those among whom, among other purposes,
he lives.<a name="FNanchor_A_33" id="FNanchor_A_33" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_33" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> A man must not retire
into solitude and cut himself off from his fellow-men. He must be
ever active to do his part in the great whole. All men are his kin,
not only in blood, but still more by participating in the same
intelligence and by being a portion of the same divinity. A man
cannot really be injured by his brethren, for no act of theirs can
make him bad, and he must not be angry with them nor hate them:
"For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like
eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against
one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against
one another to be vexed and to turn away" (<a href="#ii._1">ii.
1</a>).</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_33" id="Footnote_A_33" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_33">[A]</a> See viii. 52;
and Persius iii. 66</p>
</div>

<p>Further he says: "Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it in
passing from one social act to another social act, thinking of God"
(<a href="#vi._7">vi. 7</a>). Again: "Love mankind. Follow God"
(<a href="#vii._31">vii. 31</a>). It is the characteristic of the
rational soul for a man to love his neighbor (<a href="#xi._1">xi.
1</a>). Antoninus teaches in various passages the forgiveness of
injuries, and we know that he also practised what he taught. Bishop
Butler remarks that "this divine precept to forgive injuries and to
love our enemies, though to be met with in Gentile moralists, yet
is in a peculiar sense a precept of Christianity, as our Saviour
has insisted more upon it than on any other single virtue." The
practice of this precept is the most difficult of all virtues.
Antoninus often enforces it and gives us aid towards following it.
When we are injured, we feel anger and resentment, and the feeling
is natural, just, and useful for the conservation of society. It is
useful that wrong-doers should feel the natural consequences of
their actions, among which is the disapprobation of society and the
resentment of him who is wronged. But revenge, in the proper sense
of that word, must not be practised. "The best way of avenging
thyself," says the emperor, "is not to become like the wrong-doer."
It is plain by this that he does not mean that we should in any
case practise revenge; but he says to those who talk of revenging
wrongs, Be not like him who has done the wrong. Socrates in the
Crito (c. 10) says the same in other words, and St. Paul (Ep. to
the Romans, xii. 17). "When a man has done thee any wrong,
immediately consider with what opinion about good or evil he has
done wrong. For when thou hast seen this, thou wilt pity him and
wilt neither wonder nor be angry" (<a href="#vii._26">vii.
26</a>). Antoninus would not deny that wrong naturally produces the
feeling of anger and resentment, for this is implied in the
recommendation to reflect on the nature of the man's mind who has
done the wrong, and then you will have pity instead of resentment;
and so it comes to the same as St. Paul's advice to be angry and
sin not; which, as Butler well explains it, is not a recommendation
to be angry, which nobody needs, for anger is a natural passion,
but it is a warning against allowing anger to lead us into sin. In
short the emperor's doctrine about wrongful acts is this:
wrong-doers do not know what good and bad are: they offend out of
ignorance, and in the sense of the Stoics this is true. Though this
kind of ignorance will never be admitted as a legal excuse, and
ought not to be admitted as a full excuse in any way by society,
there may be grievous injuries, such as it is in a man's power to
forgive without harm to society; and if he forgives because he sees
that his enemies know not what they do, he is acting in the spirit
of the sublime prayer, "Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do."</p>

<p>The emperor's moral philosophy was not a feeble, narrow system,
which teaches a man to look directly to his own happiness, though a
man's happiness or tranquillity is indirectly promoted by living as
he ought to do. A man must live conformably to the universal
nature, which means, as the emperor explains it in many passages,
that a man's actions must be conformable to his true relations to
all other human beings, both as a citizen of a political community
and as a member of the whole human family. This implies, and he
often expresses it in the most forcible language, that a man's
words and actions, so far as they affect others, must be measured
by a fixed rule, which is their consistency with the conservation
and the interests of the particular society of which he is a
member, and of the whole human race. To live conformably to such a
rule, a man must use his rational faculties in order to discern
clearly the consequences and full effect of all his actions and of
the actions of others: he must not live a life of contemplation and
reflection only, though he must often retire within himself to calm
and purify his soul by thought,<a name="FNanchor_A_34" id=
"FNanchor_A_34" /><a href="#Footnote_A_34" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
but he must mingle in the work of man and be a fellow laborer for
the general good.</p>

<p>A man should have an object or purpose in life, that he may
direct all his energies to it; of course a good object (<a href=
"#ii._7">ii. 7</a>). He who has not one object or purpose of life,
cannot be one and the same all through his life (<a href=

the best means of "reducing of the mind unto virtue and good
estate; which is, the electing and propounding unto a man's self
good and virtuous ends of his life, such as may be in a reasonable
sort within his compass to attain." He is a happy man who has been
wise enough to do this when he was young and has had the
opportunities; but the emperor seeing well that a man cannot always
be so wise in his youth, encourages himself to do it when he can,
and not to let life slip away before he has begun. He who can
propose to himself good and virtuous ends of life, and be true to
them, cannot fail to live conformably to his own interest and the
universal interest, for in the nature of things they are one. If a
thing is not good for the hive, it is not good for the bee (<a
href="#vi._54">vi. 54</a>).</p>

<p>One passage may end this matter. "If the gods have determined
about me and about the things which must happen to me, they have
determined well, for it is not easy even to imagine a deity without
forethought; and as to doing me harm, why should they have any
desire towards that? For what advantage would result to them from
this or to the whole, which is the special object of their
providence? But if they have not determined about me individually,
they have certainly determined about the whole at least; and the
things which happen by way of sequence in this general arrangement
I ought to accept with pleasure and to be content with them. But if
they determine about nothing&mdash;which it is wicked to believe,
or if we do believe it, let us neither sacrifice nor pray nor swear
by them, nor do anything else which we do as if the gods were
present and lived with us; but if however the gods determine about
none of the things which concern us, I am able to determine about
myself, and I can inquire about that which is useful: and that is
useful to every man which is conformable to his own constitution
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: kataskeuê">(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;&upsilon;&#x1fc4;)</ins>
and nature. But my nature is rational and social; and my city and
country, so far as I am Antoninus, is Rome; but so far as I am a
man, it is the world. The things then which are useful to these
cities are alone useful to me" (<a href="#vi._44">vi. 44</a>).</p>

<p>It would be tedious, and it is not necessary, to state the
emperor's opinions on all the ways in which a man may profitably
use his understanding towards perfecting himself in practical
virtue. The passages to this purpose are in all parts of his book,
but as they are in no order or connection, a man must use the book
a long time before he will find out all that is in it. A few words
may be added here. If we analyze all other things, we find how
insufficient they are for human life, and how truly worthless many
of them are. Virtue alone is indivisible, one, and perfectly
satisfying. The notion of Virtue cannot be considered vague or
unsettled, because a man may find it difficult to explain the
notion fully to himself, or to expound it to others in such a way
as to prevent cavilling. Virtue is a whole, and no more consists of
parts than man's intelligence does; and yet we speak of various
intellectual faculties as a convenient way of expressing the
various powers which man's intellect shows by his works. In the
same way we may speak of various virtues or parts of virtue, in a
practical sense, for the purpose of showing what particular virtues
we ought to practice in order to the exercise of the whole of
virtue, that is, as man's nature is capable of.</p>

<p>The prime principle in man's constitution is social. The next in
order is not to yield to the persuasions of the body, when they are
not conformable to the rational principle, which must govern. The
third is freedom from error and from deception. "Let then the
ruling principle holding fast to these things go straight on, and
it has what is its own" (<a href="#vii._55">vii. 55</a>). The
emperor selects justice as the virtue which is the basis of all the
rest (<a href="#x._11">x. 11</a>), and this had been said long
before his time.</p>

<p>It is true that all people have some notion of what is meant by
justice as a disposition of the mind, and some notion about acting
in conformity to this disposition; but experience shows that men's
notions about justice are as confused as their actions are
inconsistent with the true notion of justice. The emperor's notion
of justice is clear enough, but not practical enough for all
mankind. "Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to
the things which come from the external cause; and let there be
justice in the things done by virtue of the internal cause, that
is, let there be movement and action terminating in this, in social
acts, for this is according to thy nature" (<a href="#ix._31">ix.
31</a>). In another place (<a href="#ix._1">ix. 1</a>) he says
that "he who acts unjustly acts impiously," which follows of course
from all that he says in various places. He insists on the practice
of truth as a virtue and as a means to virtue, which no doubt it
is: for lying even in indifferent things weakens the understanding;
and lying maliciously is as great a moral offense as a man can be
guilty of, viewed both as showing an habitual disposition, and
viewed with respect to consequences. He couples the notion of
justice with action. A man must not pride himself on having some
fine notion of justice in his head, but he must exhibit his justice
in act, like St. James' notion of faith. But this is enough.</p>

<p>The Stoics, and Antoninus among them, call some things beautiful
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: kala">(&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1f71;)</ins> and some ugly
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aischra">(&alpha;&#x1f30;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&#x1f71;)</ins>, and as they are beautiful
so they are good, and as they are ugly so they are evil, or bad (<a
href="#ii._1">ii. 1</a>). All these things, good and evil, are in
our power, absolutely, some of the stricter Stoics would say; in a
manner only, as those who would not depart altogether from common
sense would say; practically they are to a great degree in the
power of some persons and in some circumstances, but in a small
degree only in other persons and in other circumstances. The Stoics
maintain man's free will as to the things which are in his power;
for as to the things which are out of his power, free will
terminating in action is of course excluded by the very terms of
the expression. I hardly know if we can discover exactly Antoninus'
notion of the free will of man, nor is the question worth the
inquiry. What he does mean and does say is intelligible. All the
things which are not in our power
<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: aproaireta">(&#x1f00;&pi;&rho;&omicron;&alpha;&#x1f77;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;)</ins>
are indifferent: they are neither good nor bad, morally. Such are
life, health, wealth, power, disease, poverty, and death. Life and
death are all men's portion. Health, wealth, power, disease, and
poverty happen to men, indifferently to the good and to the bad; to
those who live according to nature and to those who do not.<a name=
"FNanchor_A_35" id="FNanchor_A_35" /><a href="#Footnote_A_35"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> "Life," says the emperor, "is a warfare
and a stranger's sojourn, and after fame is oblivion" (<a href=
"#ii._17">ii. 17</a>). After speaking of those men who have
disturbed the world and then died, and of the death of philosophers
such as Heraclitus and Democritus, who was destroyed by lice, and
of Socrates whom other lice (his enemies) destroyed, he says: "What
means all this? Thou hast embarked, thou hast made the voyage, thou
art come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no
want of gods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation,
thou wilt cease to be held by pains and pleasures, and to be a
slave to the vessel which is as much inferior as that which serves
it is superior: for the one is intelligence and Deity; the other is
earth and corruption" (<a href="#iii._3">iii. 3</a>). It is not
death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to
live according to nature (<a href="#xii._1">xii. 1</a>). Every man
should live in such a way as to discharge his duty, and to trouble
himself about nothing else. He should live such a life that he
shall always be ready for death, and shall depart content when the
summons comes. For what is death? "A cessation of the impressions
through the senses, and of the pulling of the strings which move
the appetites, and of the discursive movements of the thoughts, and
of the service to the flesh" (<a href="#vi._28">vi. 28</a>). Death
is such as generation is, a mystery of nature (<a href=
"#iv._5">iv. 5</a>). In another passage, the exact meaning of
which is perhaps doubtful (<a href="#ix._3">ix. 3</a>), he speaks
of the child which leaves the womb, and so he says the soul at
death leaves its envelope. As the child is born or comes into life
by leaving the womb, so the soul may on leaving the body pass into
another existence which is perfect. I am not sure if this is the
emperor's meaning. Butler compares it with a passage in Strabo (p.
713) about the Brachmans' notion of death being the birth into real
life and a happy life, to those who have philosophized; and he
thinks Antoninus may allude to this opinion.<a name="FNanchor_B_36"

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_B_36" id="Footnote_B_36" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_B_36">[B]</a> Seneca (Ep.
102) has the same, whether an expression of his own opinion, or
merely a fine saying of others employed to embellish his writings,
I know not. After speaking of the child being prepared in the womb
to live this life, he adds, "Sic per hoc spatium, quod ab infantia
patet in senectutem, in alium naturae sumimur partum. Alia origo
nos expectat, alius rerum status." See Ecclesiastes, xii. 7; and
Lucan, i. 457:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<div class="poem">"Longae, canitis si cognita, vitae<br />
Mors media est."</div>
</div>

<p>Antoninus' opinion of a future life is nowhere clearly
expressed. His doctrine of the nature of the soul of necessity
implies that it does not perish absolutely, for a portion of the
divinity cannot perish. The opinion is at least as old as the time
of Epicharmus and Euripides; what comes from earth goes back to
earth, and what comes from heaven, the divinity, returns to him who
gave it. But I find nothing clear in Antoninus as to the notion of
the man existing after death so as to be conscious of his sameness
with that soul which occupied his vessel of clay. He seems to be
perplexed on this matter, and finally to have rested in this, that
God or the gods will do whatever is best, and consistent with the
university of things.</p>

<p>Nor, I think, does he speak conclusively on another Stoic
doctrine, which some Stoics practised,&mdash;the anticipating the
regular course of nature by a man's own act. The reader will find
some passages in which this is touched on, and he may make of them
what he can. But there are passages in which the emperor encourages
himself to wait for the end patiently and with tranquillity; and
certainly it is consistent with all his best teaching that a man
should bear all that falls to his lot and do useful acts as he
lives. He should not therefore abridge the time of his usefulness
by his own act. Whether he contemplates any possible cases in which
a man should die by his own hand, I cannot tell; and the matter is
not worth a curious inquiry, for I believe it would not lead to any
certain result as to his opinion on this point. I do not think that
Antoninus, who never mentions Seneca, though he must have known all
about him, would have agreed with Seneca when he gives as a reason
for suicide, that the eternal law, whatever he means, has made
nothing better for us than this, that it has given us only one way
of entering into life and many ways of going out of it. The ways of
going out indeed are many, and that is a good reason for a man
taking care of himself.<a name="FNanchor_A_37" id=

<p>Happiness was not the direct object of a Stoic's life. There is
no rule of life contained in the precept that a man should pursue
his own happiness. Many men think that they are seeking happiness
when they are only seeking the gratification of some particular
passion, the strongest that they have. The end of a man is, as
already explained, to live conformably to nature, and he will thus
obtain happiness, tranquillity of mind, and contentment (<a href=
"#iii._12">iii. 12</a>; <a href="#vii._1">viii. 1</a>, and other
places). As a means of living conformably to nature he must study
the four chief virtues, each of which has its proper sphere:
wisdom, or the knowledge of good and evil; justice, or the giving
to every man his due; fortitude, or the enduring of labor and pain;
and temperance, which is moderation in all things. By thus living
conformably to nature the Stoic obtained all that he wished or
expected. His reward was in his virtuous life, and he was satisfied
with that. Some Greek poet long ago wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"For virtue only of all human things<br />
Takes her reward not from the hands of others.<br />
Virtue herself rewards the toils of virtue."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the Stoics indeed expressed themselves in very arrogant,
absurd terms, about the wise man's self-sufficiency; they elevated
him to the rank of a deity.<a name="FNanchor_A_38" id=
"FNanchor_A_38" /><a href="#Footnote_A_38" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But these were only talkers and lecturers, such as those in all
ages who utter fine words, know little of human affairs, and care
only for notoriety. Epictetus and Antoninus both by precept and
example labored to improve themselves and others; and if we
discover imperfections in their teaching, we must still honor these
great men who attempted to show that there is in man's nature and
in the constitution of things sufficient reason for living a
virtuous life. It is difficult enough to live as we ought to live,
difficult even for any man to live in such a way as to satisfy
himself, if he exercises only in a moderate degree the power of
reflecting upon and reviewing his own conduct; and if all men
cannot be brought to the same opinions in morals and religion, it
is at least worth while to give them good reasons for as much as
they can be persuaded to accept.</p>

the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all, a
polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom
of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most
of all the freedom of the governed; I learned from him also +
consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for philosophy;
and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to
cherish good hopes, and to believe that I am loved by my friends;
and in him I observed no concealment of his opinions with respect

self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and
cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a
just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and
to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that
everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all
that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed
amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off
doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever
laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever
passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of
beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all
falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not
be diverted from right, rather than of a man who had been improved.
I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised
by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had
also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.+</p>

class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I observed mildness of temper, and
unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determined after
due deliberation; and no vain-glory in those things which men call
honors; and a love of labor and perseverance; and a readiness to
listen to those who had anything to propose for the common weal;
and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according to his
deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions
for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had
overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more
than any other citizen;<a name="FNanchor_B_54" id=
"FNanchor_B_54" /><a href="#Footnote_B_54" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or
to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had
failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances,
always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful
inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and
that he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied
with appearances which first present themselves; and that his
disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired of
them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be
satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a
long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and
to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be
ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the
administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the
expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for
such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the
gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or
by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things,
and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of
novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity
of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used
without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had
them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them
not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was
either a sophist or a [home-bred] flippant slave or a pedant; but
every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above
flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides
this, he honored those who were true philosophers, and he did not
reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he
easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made
himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a
reasonable care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly
attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet
in a careless way, but so that through his own attention he very
seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or
external applications. He was most ready to give without envy to
those who possessed any particular faculty, such as that of
eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything
else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation
according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the
institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of
doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he
loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the
same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came
immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His
secrets were not many, but very few and very rare, and these only
about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the
exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public
buildings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he
was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the
reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath
at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor
curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and color of his
clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves.<a name="FNanchor_C_55"

We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked
his pardon; and such was all his behavior. There was in him nothing
harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything
carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things
severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion,
in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be
applied to him which is recorded of Socrates,<a name=
"FNanchor_E_57" id="FNanchor_E_57" /><a href="#Footnote_E_57"
class="fnanchor">[E]</a> that he was able both to abstain from, and
to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and
cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear
the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a
perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of
Maximus.</p>

<p><a name="i._17" id="i._17">17.</a> To the gods I am indebted
for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good
teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly
everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not
hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a
disposition which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to
do something of this kind; but, through their favor, there never
was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial.
Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up
with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved the flower of
my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the
proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to
a ruler and father who was able to take away all pride from me, and
to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live
in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses,
or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such
a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a
private person, without being for this reason either meaner in
thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which
must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a
ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother,<a name=

class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who was able by his moral character to
rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who at the same time pleased
me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been
stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency
in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should
perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was
making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who
brought me up in the station of honor, which they seemed to desire,
without putting them off with hope of my doing it some other time
after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius,
Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions
about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is,
so that, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help,
and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith living
according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own
fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and,
I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held
out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either
Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory
passions, I was cured, and, though I was often out of humor with
Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent;
that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the
last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any
man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I
had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same
necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I
have such a wife,<a name="FNanchor_B_59" id="FNanchor_B_59" /><a

affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters

both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness<a name=

to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and
that I did not waste my time on writers [of histories], or in the
resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation
of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the
help of the gods and fortune.</p>

advantage of the whole universe, of which thou art a part. But that
is good for every part of nature which the nature of the whole

anger. For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from
reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who
offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be
in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences.
Rightly, then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the
offence which is committed with pleasure is more blamable than that
which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more like
a person who has been first wronged and through pain is compelled
to be angry, but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong,

universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence? But in truth they
do exist, and they do care for human things, and they have put all
the means in man's power to enable him not to fall into real evils.
And as to the rest, if there was anything evil, they would have
provided for this also, that it should be altogether in a man's
power not to fall into it. Now that which does not make a man
worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But neither through
ignorance, nor&mdash; having the knowledge but not the power to
guard against or correct these things, is it possible that the
nature of the universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible that
it has made so great a mistake, either through want of power or
want of skill, that good and evil should happen indiscriminately to
the good and the bad. But death certainly, and life, honor and

the daemon within him, and to reverence it sincerely. And reverence
of the daemon consists in keeping it pure from passion and
thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what comes from gods and
men. For the things from the gods merit veneration for their
excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason
of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by
reason of men's ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not
less than that which deprives us of the power of distinguishing

that all things from eternity are of like forms and come round in a

<p><a name="ii._16" id="ii._16">16.</a> The soul of man does
violence to itself, first of all, when it becomes an abscess, and,
as it were, a tumor on the universe, so far as it can. For to be
vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from
nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are
contained. In the next place, the soul does violence to itself when
it turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the
intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who are
angry. In the third place, the soul does violence to itself when it
is overpowered by pleasure or by pain. Fourthly, when it plays a
part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. Fifthly,
when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an
aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what
it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with
reference to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow
the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity.</p>

<p><a name="ii._17" id="ii._17">17.</a> Of human life the time is
a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull,
and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and
the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing
devoid of judgment. And, to say all in a word, everything which
belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a
dream and vapor, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn,
and after fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to
conduct a man? One thing, and only one, philosophy. But this
consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and
unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a
purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need
of another man's doing or not doing anything; and besides,
accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming
from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and,
finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing
else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being
is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves
in each continually changing into another, why should a man have
any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the
elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which
is according to nature.</p>

<p><a name="iii._1" id="iii._1"></a>We ought to consider not only
that our life is daily wasting away and a smaller part of it is
left, but another thing also must be taken into the account, that
if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain whether the
understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension
of things, and retain the power of contemplation which strives to
acquire the knowledge of the divine and the human. For if he shall
begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and
imagination and appetite, and whatever else there is of the kind,
will not fail; but the power of making use of ourselves, and
filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating all
appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from
life, and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a
disciplined reason,&mdash;all this is already extinguished. We must
make haste, then, not only because we are daily nearer to death,
but also because the conception of things and the understanding of
them cease first.</p>

<p><a name="iii._2" id="iii._2">2.</a> We ought to observe also
that even the things which follow after the things which are
produced according to nature contain something pleasing and
attractive. For instance, when bread is baked some parts are split
at the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain
fashion contrary to the purpose of the baker's art, are beautiful
in a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And
again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe
olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds
a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down,
and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of
wild boars, and many other things,&mdash;though they are far from
being beautiful if a man should examine them
severally,&mdash;still, because they are consequent upon the things
which are formed by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the
mind; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight
with respect to the things which are produced in the universe,
there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence
which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give
pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild
beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and
sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he
will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the
attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on
with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not
pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly
familiar with Nature and her works.</p>

<p><a name="iii._3" id="iii._3">3.</a> Hippocrates, after curing
many diseases, himself fell sick and died. The Chaldaei foretold
the deaths of many, and then fate caught them too. Alexander and
Pompeius, and Caius Caesar, after so often completely destroying
whole cities, and in battle cutting to pieces many ten thousands of
cavalry and infantry, themselves too at last departed from life.
Heraclitus, after so many speculations on the conflagration of the
universe, was filled with water internally and died smeared all
over with mud. And lice destroyed Democritus; and other lice killed
Socrates. What means all this? Thou hast embarked, thou hast made
the voyage, thou art come to shore; get out. If indeed to another
life, there is no want of gods, not even there; but if to a state
without sensation, thou wilt cease to be held by pains and
pleasures, and to be a slave to the vessel, which is as much
inferior as that which serves it is superior:+ for the one is
intelligence and deity; the other is earth and corruption.</p>

<p><a name="iii._4" id="iii._4">4.</a> Do not waste the remainder
of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy
thoughts to some object of common utility. For thou losest the
opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as
these,&mdash;What is such a person doing, and why, and what is he
saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he contriving, and
whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation
of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of
our thoughts everything that is without a purpose and useless, but
most of all the over-curious feeling and the malignant; and a man
should use himself to think of those things only about which if one
should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? with
perfect openness thou mightest immediately answer, This or That; so
that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee is
simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, and one
that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments at
all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else
for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst
it in thy mind. For the man who is such, and no longer delays being
among the number of the best, is like a priest and minister of the
gods, using too the [deity] which is planted within him, which
makes the man uncontaminated by pleasure, unharmed by any pain,
untouched by any insult, feeling no wrong, a fighter in the noblest
fight, one who cannot be overpowered by any passion, dyed deep with
justice, accepting with all his soul everything which happens and
is assigned to him as his portion; and not often, nor yet without
great necessity and for the general interest, imagining what
another says, or does, or thinks. For it is only what belongs to
himself that he makes the matter for his activity; and he
constantly thinks of that which is allotted to himself out of the
sum total of things, and he makes his own acts fair, and he is
persuaded that his own portion is good. For the lot which is
assigned to each man is carried along with him and carries him
along with it.+ And he remembers also that every rational animal is
his kinsman, and that to care for all men is according to man's
nature; and a man should hold on to the opinion not of all, but of
those only who confessedly live according to nature. But as to
those who live not so, he always bears in mind what kind of men
they are both at home and from home, both by night and by day, and
what they are, and with what men they live an impure life.
Accordingly, he does not value at all the praise which comes from
such men, since they are not even satisfied with themselves.</p>

<p><a name="iii._5" id="iii._5">5.</a> Labor not unwillingly, nor
without regard to the common interest, nor without due
consideration, nor with distraction; nor let studied ornament set
off thy thoughts, and be not either a man of many words, or busy
about too many things. And further, let the deity which is in thee
be the guardian of a living being, manly and of ripe age, and
engaged in matter political, and a Roman, and a ruler, who has
taken his post like a man waiting for the signal which summons him
from life, and ready to go, having need neither of oath nor of any
man's testimony. Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor
the tranquillity which others give. A man then must stand erect,
not be kept erect by others.</p>

<p><a name="iii._6" id="iii._6">6.</a> If thou findest in human
life anything better than justice, truth, temperance, fortitude,
and, in a word, anything better than thy own mind's
self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do
according to right reason, and in the condition that is assigned to
thee without thy own choice; if, I say, thou seest anything better
than this, turn to it with all thy soul, and enjoy that which thou
hast found to be the best. But if nothing appears to be better than
the Deity which is planted in thee, which has subjected to itself
all thy appetites, and carefully examines all the impressions, and,
as Socrates said, has detached itself from the persuasions of
sense, and has submitted itself to the gods, and cares for mankind;
if thou findest everything else smaller and of less value than
this, give place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and
incline to it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to
give the preference to that good thing which is thy proper
possession and thy own; for it is not right that anything of any
other kind, such as praise from the many, or power, or <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: Should be enjoyment.">enioyment</ins> of
pleasure, should come into competition with that which is
rationally and politically [or, practically] good. All these
things, even though they may seem to adapt themselves [to the
better things] in a small degree, obtain the superiority all at
once, and carry us away. But do thou, I say, simply and freely
choose the better, and hold to it.&mdash;But that which is useful
is the better.&mdash;Well, then, if it is useful to thee as a
rational being, keep to it; but if it is only useful to thee as an
animal, say so, and maintain thy judgment without arrogance: only
take care that thou makest the inquiry by a sure method.</p>

intelligence and daemon and the worship of its excellence, acts no

but whether for a longer or a shorter time he shall have the soul
enclosed in the body, he cares not at all: for even if he must
depart immediately, he will go as readily as if he were going to do
anything else which can be done with decency and order; taking care
of this only all through life, that his thoughts turn not away from
anything which belongs to an intelligent animal and a member of a

it entirely depends whether there shall exist in thy ruling part
any opinion inconsistent with nature and the constitution of the

gods.</p>

<p><a name="iii._10" id="iii._10">10.</a> Throwing away then all
things, hold to these only which are few; and besides, bear in mind
that every man lives only this present time, which is an
indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past
or it is uncertain. Short then is the time which every man lives;
and small the nook of the earth where he lives; and short too the
longest posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a
succession of poor human beings, who will very soon die, and who
know not even themselves, much less him who died long ago.</p>

<p><a name="iii._11" id="iii._11">11.</a> To the aids which have
been mentioned let this one still be added: Make for thyself a
definition or description of the thing which is presented to thee,
so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its
substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell
thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it
has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For
nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to
examine methodically and truly every object which is presented to
thee in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same
time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything
performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the
whole, and what with reference to man, who is a citizen of the
highest city, of which all other cities are like families; what
each thing is, and of what it is composed, and how long it is the
nature of this thing to endure which now makes an impression on me,
and what virtue I have need of with respect to it, such as
gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment,
and the rest. Wherefore, on every occasion a man should say: This
comes from god; and this is according to the apportionment + and
spinning of the thread of destiny, and such-like coincidence and
chance; and this is from one of the same stock, and a kinsman and
partner, one who knows not, however, what is according to his
nature. But I know; for this reason I behave towards him according
to the natural law of fellowship with benevolence and justice. At
the same time, however, in things indifferent<a name=

class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I attempt to ascertain the value of
each.</p>

utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to
prevent this.</p>

the things which appear suitable belongs also to those who do not
believe in the gods, and who betray their country, and do their
impure deeds when they have shut the doors. If then everything else
is common to all that I have mentioned, there remains that which is
peculiar to the good man, to be pleased and content with what
happens, and with the thread which is spun for him; and not to
defile the divinity which is planted in his breast, nor disturb it
by a crowd of images, but to preserve it tranquil, following it
obediently as a god, neither saying anything contrary to the truth,
nor doing anything contrary to justice. And if all men refuse to
believe that he lives a simple, modest, and contented life, he is
neither angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the way
which leads to the end of life, to which a man ought to come pure,
tranquil, ready to depart, and without any compulsion perfectly

of thy own,<a name="FNanchor_A_76" id="FNanchor_A_76" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_76" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and above all do not
distract or strain thyself, but be free, and look at things as a
man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal. But among the
things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt turn, let there be
these, which are two. One is that things do not touch the soul, for
they are external and remain immovable; but our perturbations come
only from the opinion which is within. The other is that all these
things, which thou seest, change immediately and will no longer be;
and constantly bear in mind how many of these changes thou hast
already witnessed. The universe is transformation: life is
opinion.</p>

does the earth contain the bodies of those who have been buried
from time so remote? For as here the mutation of these bodies after
a certain continuance, whatever it may be, and their dissolution,
make room for other dead bodies, so the souls which are removed
into the air after subsisting for some time are transmuted and
diffused, and assume a fiery nature by being received into the
seminal intelligence of the universe, and in this way make room for
the fresh souls which come to dwell there. And this is the answer
which a man might give on the hypothesis of souls continuing to
exist. But we must not only think of the number of bodies which are
thus buried, but also of the number of animals which are daily
eaten by us and the other animals. For what a number is consumed,
and thus in a manner buried in the bodies of those who feed on
them! And nevertheless this earth receives them by reason of the
changes [of these bodies] into blood, and the transformations into
the aerial or the fiery element.</p>

only the tranquillity which comes from doing well, but also that
which comes from doing few things. For the greatest part of what we
say and do being unnecessary, if a man takes this away, he will
have more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly, on every
occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary
things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but
also unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not

<p><a name="iv._32" id="iv._32">32.</a> Consider, for example,
the times of Vespasian. Thou wilt see all these things, people
marrying, bringing up children, sick, dying, warring, feasting,
trafficking, cultivating the ground, flattering, obstinately
arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for some to die, grumbling
about the present, loving, heaping up treasure, desiring
consulship, kingly power. Well, then, that life of these people no
longer exists at all. Again, remove to the times of Trajan. Again,
all is the same. Their life too is gone. In like manner view also
the other epochs of time and of whole nations, and see how many
after great efforts soon fell and were resolved into the elements.
But chiefly thou shouldst think of those whom thou hast thyself
known distracting themselves about idle things, neglecting to do
what was in accordance with their proper constitution, and to hold
firmly to this and to be content with it. And herein it is
necessary to remember that the attention given to everything has
its proper value and proportion. For thus thou wilt not be

soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon
buries them. And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous
way. For the rest, as soon as they have breathed out their breath
they are gone, and no man speaks of them. And, to conclude the
matter, what is even an eternal remembrance? A mere nothing. What
then is that about which we ought to employ our serious pains? This
one thing, thoughts just, and acts social, and words which never
lie, and a disposition which gladly accepts all that happens, as

not subsist in the ruling principle of another; nor yet in any

It is in that part of thee in which subsists the power of forming
opinions about evils. Let this power then not form [such] opinions,
and all is well. And if that which is nearest to it, the poor body,
is cut, burnt, filled with matter and rottenness, nevertheless let
the part which forms opinions about these things be quiet; that is,
let it judge that nothing is either bad or good which can happen
equally to the bad man and the good. For that which happens equally
to him who lives contrary to nature and to him who lives according
to nature, is neither according to nature nor contrary to
nature.</p>

those which follow are always aptly fitted to those which have gone
before: for this series is not like a mere enumeration of
disjointed things, which has only a necessary sequence, but it is a
rational connection: and as all existing things are arranged
together harmoniously, so the things which come into existence
exhibit no mere succession, but a certain wonderful relationship
(<a href="#vi._38">vi. 38</a>; <a href="#vii._9">vii. 9</a>; <a

<p>46. Always remember the saying of Heraclitus, that the death of
earth is to become water, and the death of water is to become air,
and the death of air is to become fire, and reversely. And think
too of him who forgets whither the way leads, and that men quarrel
with that with which they are most constantly in communion, the
reason which governs the universe; and the things which they daily
meet with seem to them strange: and consider that we ought not to
act and speak as if we were asleep, for even in sleep we seem to
act and speak; and that + we ought not, like children who learn
from their parents, simply to act and speak as we have been taught.

<p>47. If any god told thee that thou shalt die to-morrow, or
certainly on the day after to-morrow, thou wouldst not care much
whether it was on the third day or on the morrow, unless thou wast
in the highest degree mean-spirited; for how small is the
difference! So think it no great thing to die after as many years
as thou canst name rather than to-morrow.</p>

<p><a name="iv._48" id="iv._48">48.</a> Think continually how
many physicians are dead after often contracting their eyebrows

pretensions the deaths of others; and how many philosophers after
endless discourses on death or immortality; how many heroes after
killing thousands; and how many tyrants who have used their power
over men's lives with terrible insolence, as if they were immortal;
and how many cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice<a name=

innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast known, one
after another. One man after burying another has been laid out
dead, and another buries him; and all this in a short time. To
conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless human things
are, and what was yesterday a little mucus, to-morrow will be a
mummy or ashes. Pass then through this little space of time
conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, as an olive
falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and
thanking the tree on which it grew.</p>

do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into
the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bed-clothes
and keep myself warm?&mdash;But this is more pleasant.&mdash;Dost
thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or
exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds,
the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order
their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do
the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that
which, is according to thy nature? But it is necessary to take rest
also.&mdash;It is necessary. However, Nature has fixed bounds to
this too: she has fixed bounds to eating and drinking, and yet thou
goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy
acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do.
So thou lovest not thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love
thy nature and her will. But those who love their several arts
exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food;
but thou valuest thy own nature less than the turner values the
turning art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the lover of money
values his money, or the vain-glorious man his little glory. And
such men, when they have a violent affection to a thing, choose
neither to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect the things which
they care for. But are the acts which concern society more vile in
thy eyes and less worthy of thy labor?</p>

it unworthy of thee. For those persons have their peculiar leading
principle and follow their peculiar movement; which things do not
thou regard, but go straight on, following thy own nature and the
common nature; and the way of both is one.</p>

<p>4. I go through the things which happen according to nature
until I shall fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that
element out of which I daily draw it in, and falling upon that
earth out of which my father collected the seed, and my mother the
blood, and my nurse the milk; out of which during so many years I
have been supplied with food and drink; which bears me when I tread
on it and abuse it for so many purposes.</p>

the sharpness of thy wits.&mdash;Be it so: but there are many other
things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed from them by
nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy
power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labor, aversion to
pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things,
benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from
trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou
art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of
natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest
voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being
defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to
flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please
men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind?
No, by the gods; but thou mightest have been delivered from these
things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being
rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself
about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy
dullness.</p>

<p><a name="v._6" id="v._6">6.</a> One man, when he has done a
service to another, is ready to set it down to his account as a
favor conferred. Another is not ready to do this, but still in his
own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor, and he knows what he
has done. A third in a manner does not even know what he has done,
but he is like a vine which has produced grapes, and seeks for
nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit. As a
horse when he has run, a dog when he has tackled the game, a bee
when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act
does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to
another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in
season.&mdash;Must a man then be one of these, who in a manner act
thus without observing it?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;But this very thing is
necessary, the observation of what a man is doing: for, it may be
said, it is characteristic of the social animal to perceive that he
is working in a social manner, and indeed to wish that his social
partner also should perceive it.&mdash;It is true that thou sayest,
but thou dost not rightly understand what is now said: and for this
reason thou wilt become one of those of whom I spoke before, for
even they are misled by a certain show of reason. But if thou wilt
choose to understand the meaning of what is said, do not fear that
for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.</p>

<p><a name="v._7" id="v._7">7.</a> A prayer of the Athenians:
Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on the ploughed fields of the

all, or we ought to pray in this simple and noble fashion.</p>

<p><a name="v._8" id="v._8">8.</a> Just as we must understand
when it is said, That Aesculapius prescribed to this man
horse-exercise, or bathing in cold water, or going without shoes,
so we must understand it when it is said, That the nature of the
universe prescribed to this man disease, or mutilation, or loss, or
anything else of the kind. For in the first case Prescribed means
something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing
adapted to procure health; and in the second case it means, That
which happens<a name="FNanchor_A_81" id="FNanchor_A_81" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_81" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> to [or suits] every man
is fixed in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. For this is
what we mean when we say that things are suitable to us, as the
workmen say of squared stones in walls or the pyramids, that they
are suitable, when they fit them to one another in some kind of
connection. For there is altogether one fitness [harmony]. And as
the universe is made up out of all bodies to be such a body as it
is, so out of all existing causes necessity [destiny] is made up to
be such a cause as it is. And even those who are completely
ignorant understand what I mean; for they say, It [necessity,
destiny] brought this to such a person.&mdash;This then was brought
and this was prescribed to him. Let us then receive these things,
as well as those which Aesculapius prescribes. Many as a matter of
course even among his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept
them in the hope of health. Let the perfecting and accomplishment
of the things which the common nature judges to be good, be judged
by thee to be of the same kind as thy health. And so accept
everything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it
leads to this, to the health of the universe and to the prosperity
and felicity of Zeus [the universe]. For he would not have brought
on any man what he has brought, if it were not useful for the
whole. Neither does the nature of anything, whatever it may be,
cause anything which is not suitable to that which is directed by
it. For two reasons then it is right to be content with that which
happens to thee; the one, because it was done for thee and
prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee,
originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and
the other, because even that which comes severally to every man is
to the power which administers the universe a cause of felicity and
perfection, nay even of its very continuance. For the integrity of
the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything whatever from
the conjunction and the continuity either of the parts or of the
causes. And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when
thou art dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out
of the way.</p>

discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost not succeed in doing
everything according to right principles, but when thou hast
failed, return back again, and be content if the greater part of
what thou doest is consistent with man's nature, and love this to
which thou returnest; and do not return to philosophy as if she
were a master, but act like those who have sore eyes and apply a
bit of sponge and egg, or as another applies a plaster, or
drenching with water. For thus thou wilt not fail to + obey reason,
and thou wilt repose in it. And remember that philosophy requires
only things which thy nature requires; but thou wouldst have
something else which is not according to nature.&mdash;It may be
objected, Why, what is more agreeable than this [which I am doing]?
But is not this the very reason why pleasure deceives us? And
consider if magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, equanimity, piety,
are not more agreeable. For what is more agreeable than wisdom
itself, when thou thinkest of the security and the happy course of
all things which depend on the faculty of understanding and
knowledge?</p>

<p><a name="v._10" id="v._10">10.</a> Things are in such a kind
of envelopment that they have seemed to philosophers, not a few nor
those common philosophers, altogether unintelligible; nay even to
the Stoics themselves they seem difficult to understand. And all
our assent is changeable; for where is the man who never changes?
Carry thy thoughts then to the objects themselves, and consider how
short-lived they are and worthless, and that they may be in the
possession of a filthy wretch or a whore or a robber. Then turn to
the morals of those who live with thee, and it is hardly possible
to endure even the most agreeable of them, to say nothing of a man
being hardly able to endure himself. In such darkness then and
dirt, and in so constant a flux both of substance and of time, and
of motion and of things moved, what there is worth being highly
prized, or even an object of serious pursuit, I cannot imagine. But
on the contrary it is a man's duty to comfort himself, and to wait
for the natural dissolution, and not to be vexed at the delay, but
to rest in these principles only: the one, that nothing will happen
to me which is not conformable to the nature of the universe; and
the other, that it is in my power never to act contrary to my god
and daemon: for there is no man who will compel me to this.</p>

<p><a name="v._11" id="v._11">11.</a> About what am I now
employing my own soul? On every occasion I must ask myself this
question, and inquire, What have I now in this part of me which
they call the ruling principle? and whose soul have I
now,&mdash;that of a child, or of a young man, or of a feeble
woman, or of a tyrant, or of a domestic animal, or of a wild
beast?</p>

<p>12. What kind of things those are which appear good to the many,
we may learn even from this. For if any man should conceive certain
things as being really good, such as prudence, temperance, justice,
fortitude, he would not after having first conceived these endure
to listen to anything+ which should not be in harmony with what is
really good.+ But if a man has first conceived as good the things
which appear to the many to be good, he will listen and readily
receive as very applicable that which was said by the comic writer.
+Thus even the many perceive the difference.+ For were it not so,
this saying would not offend and would not be rejected [in the
first case], while we receive it when it is said of wealth, and of
the means which further luxury and fame, as said fitly and wittily.
Go on then and ask if we should value and think those things to be
good, to which after their first conception in the mind the words
of the comic writer might be aptly applied,&mdash;that he who has
them, through pure abundance has not a place to ease himself
in.</p>

<p><a name="v._13" id="v._13">13.</a> I am composed of the formal
and the material; and neither of them will perish into
non-existence, as neither of them came into existence out of
non-existence. Every part of me then will be reduced by change into
some part of the universe, and that again will change into another
part of the universe, and so on forever. And by consequence of such
a change I too exist, and those who begot me, and so on forever in
the other direction. For nothing hinders us from saying so, even if
the universe is administered according to definite periods [of
revolution].</p>

<p>14. Reason and the reasoning art [philosophy] are powers which
are sufficient for themselves and for their own works. They move
then from a first principle which is their own, and they make their
way to the end which is proposed to them; and this is the reason
why such acts are named Catorthoseis or right acts, which word
signifies that they proceed by the right road.</p>

<p>15. None of these things ought to be called a man's, which do
not belong to a man, as man. They are not required of a man, nor
does man's nature promise them, nor are they the means of man's
nature attaining its end. Neither then does the end of man lie in
these things, nor yet that which aids to the accomplishment of this
end, and that which aids toward this end is that which is good.
Besides, if any of these things did belong to man, it would not be
right for a man to despise them and to set himself against them;
nor would a man be worthy of praise who snowed that he did not want
these things, nor would he who stinted himself in any of them be
good, if indeed these things were good. But now the more of these
things a man deprives himself of, or of other things like them, or
even when he is deprived of any of them, the more patiently he
endures the loss, just in the same degree he is a better man.</p>

<p><a name="v._16" id="v._16">16.</a> Such as are thy habitual
thoughts, such also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul
is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of
such thoughts as these: for instance, that where a man can live,
there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace; well
then, he can also live well in a palace. And again, consider that
for whatever purpose each thing has been constituted, for this it
has been constituted, and towards this it is carried; and its end
is in that towards which it is carried; and where the end is, there
also is the advantage and the good of each thing. Now the good for
the reasonable animal is society; for that we are made for society
has been shown above.<a name=

<p><a name="v._18" id="v._18">18.</a> Nothing happens to any man
which he is not formed by nature to bear. The same things happen to
another, and either because he does not see that they have
happened, or because he would show a great spirit, he is firm and
remains unharmed. It is a shame then that ignorance and conceit
should be stronger than wisdom.</p>

<p>19. Things themselves touch not the soul, not in the least
degree; nor have they admission to the soul, nor can they turn or
move the soul: but the soul turns and moves itself alone, and
whatever judgments it may think proper to make, such it makes for
itself the things which present themselves to it.</p>

<p><a name="v._20" id="v._20">20.</a> In one respect man is the
nearest thing to me, so far as I must do good to men and endure
them. But so far as some men make themselves obstacles to my proper
acts, man becomes to me one of the things which are indifferent, no
less than the sun or wind or a wild beast. Now it is true that
these may impede my action, but they are no impediments to my
affects and disposition, which have the power of acting
conditionally and changing: for the mind converts and changes every
hindrance to its activity into an aid; and so that which is a
hindrance is made a furtherance to an act; and that which is an
obstacle on the road helps us on this road.</p>

<p><a name="v._21" id="v._21">21.</a> Reverence that which is
best in the universe; and this is that which makes use of all
things and directs all things. And in like manner also reverence
that which is best in thyself; and this is of the same kind as
that. For in thyself also, that which makes use of everything else
is this, and thy life is directed by this.</p>

<p>22. That which does no harm to the state, does no harm to the
citizen. In the case of every appearance of harm apply this rule:
if the state is not harmed by this, neither am I harmed. But if the
state is harmed, thou must not be angry with him who does harm to
the state. Show him where his error is.</p>

<p><a name="v._23" id="v._23">23.</a> Often think of the rapidity
with which things pass by and disappear, both the things which are
and the things which are produced. For substance is like a river in
a continual flow, and the activities of things are in constant
change, and the causes work in infinite varieties; and there is
hardly anything which stands still. And consider this which is near
to thee, this boundless abyss of the past and of the future in
which all things disappear. How then is he not a fool who is puffed
up with such things or plagued about them and makes himself
miserable? for they vex him only for a time, and a short time.</p>

<p><a name="v._24" id="v._24">24.</a> Think of the universal
substance, of which thou hast a very small portion; and of
universal time, of which a short and indivisible interval has been
assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by destiny, and how
small a part of it thou art.</p>

<p><a name="v._25" id="v._25">25.</a> Does another do me wrong?
Let him look to it. He has his own disposition, his own activity. I
now have what the universal nature now wills me to have; and I do
what my nature now wills me to do.</p>

<p><a name="v._26" id="v._26">26.</a> Let the part of thy soul
which leads and governs be undisturbed by the movements in the
flesh, whether of pleasure or of pain; and let it not unite with
them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit those affects to
their parts. But when these affects rise up to the mind by virtue
of that other sympathy that naturally exists in a body which is all
one, then thou must not strive to resist the sensation, for it is
natural: but let not the ruling part of itself add to the sensation
the opinion that it is either good or bad.</p>

<p><a name="v._27" id="v._27">27.</a> Live with the gods. And he
does live with the gods who constantly shows to them that his own

man's understanding and reason.</p>

from such things: but the man has reason, it will be said, and he
is able, if he takes pains, to discover wherein he offends; I wish
thee well of thy discovery. Well then, and thou hast reason: by thy
rational faculty stir up his rational faculty; show him his error,
admonish him. For if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there is
no need of anger. [+ Neither tragic actor nor whore. +]<a name=

whether thou art drowsy or satisfied with sleep; and whether

of the universe every single thing is accomplished; for certainly
it is not in conformity to any other nature that each thing is
accomplished, either a nature which externally comprehends this, or
a nature which is comprehended within this nature, or a nature
external and independent of this (<a href="#xi._1">xi. 1</a>; <a

<p><a name="vi._10" id="vi._10">10.</a> The universe is either a
confusion, and a mutual involution of things, and a dispersion, or
it is unity and order and providence. If then it is the former, why
do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination of things and such
a disorder? and why do I care about anything else than how I shall
at last become earth? and why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of
my elements will happen whatever I do? But if the other supposition
is true, I venerate, and I am firm, and I trust in him who governs
(<a href="#iv._27">iv. 27</a>).</p>

<p><a name="vi._12" id="vi._12">12.</a> If thou hadst a

whom what thou meetest with in the court appears to thee tolerable,
and thou appearest tolerable in the court.</p>

<p><a name="vi._13" id="vi._13">13.</a> When we have meat before
us and such eatables, we receive the impression that this is the
dead body of a fish, and this the dead body of a bird or of a pig;
and again, that this Falernian is only a little grape-juice, and
this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a
shell-fish: such then are these impressions, and they reach the
things themselves and penetrate them, and so we see what kind of
things they are. Just in the same way ought we to act all through
life, and where there are things which appear most worthy of our
approbation, we ought to lay them bare and look at their
worthlessness and strip them of all the words by which they are
exalted. For outward show is a wonderful perverter of the reason,
and when thou art most sure that thou art employed about things
worth thy pains, it is then that it cheats thee most. Consider then
what Crates says of Xenocrates himself.</p>

<p><a name="vi._14" id="vi._14">14.</a> Most of the things which
the multitude admire are referred to objects of the most general
kind, those which are held together by cohesion or natural
organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines, olives. But
those which are admired by men, who are a little more reasonable,
are referred to the things which are held together by a living
principle, as flocks, herds. Those which are admired by men who are
still more instructed are the things which are held together by a
rational soul, not however a universal soul, but rational so far as
it is a soul skilled in some art, or expert in some other way, or
simply rational so far as it possesses a number of slaves. But he
who values a rational soul, a soul universal and fitted for
political life, regards nothing else except this; and above all
things he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity
conformable to reason and social life, and he co-operates to this
end with those who are of the same kind as himself.</p>

<p><a name="vi._15" id="vi._15">15.</a> Some things are hurrying
into existence, and others are hurrying out of it; and of that
which is coming into existence part is already extinguished.
Motions and changes are continually renewing the world, just as the
uninterrupted course of time is always renewing the infinite
duration of ages. In this flowing stream then, on which there is no
abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man
would set a high price? It would be just as if a man should fall in
love with one of the sparrows which fly by, but it has already
passed out of sight. Something of this kind is the very life of
every man, like the exhalation of the blood and the respiration of
the air. For such as it is to have once drawn in the air and to
have given it back, which we do every moment, just the same is it
with the whole respiratory power, which thou didst receive at thy
birth yesterday and the day before, to give it back to the element
from which thou didst first draw it.</p>

<p><a name="vi._16" id="vi._16">16.</a> Neither is transpiration,
as in plants, a thing to be valued, nor respiration, as in
domesticated animals and wild beasts, nor the receiving of
impressions by the appearances of things, nor being moved by
desires as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds, nor being
nourished by food; for this is just like the act of separating and
parting with the useless part of our food. What then is worth being
valued? To be received with clapping of hands? No. Neither must we
value the clapping of tongues; for the praise which comes from the
many is a clapping of tongues. Suppose then that thou hast given up
this worthless thing called fame, what remains that is worth
valuing? This, in my opinion: to move thyself and to restrain
thyself in conformity to thy proper constitution, to which end both
all employments and arts lead. For every art aims at this, that the
thing which has been made should be adapted to the work for which
it has been made; and both the vine-planter who looks after the
vine, and the horse-breaker, and he who trains the dog, seek this
end. But the education and the teaching of youth aim at something.
In this then is the value of the education and the teaching. And if
this is well, thou wilt not seek anything else. Wilt thou not cease
to value many other things too? Then thou wilt be neither free, nor
sufficient for thy own happiness, nor without passion. For of
necessity thou must be envious, jealous, and suspicious of those
who can take away those things, and plot against those who have
that which is valued by thee. Of necessity a man must be altogether
in a state of perturbation who wants any of these things; and
besides, he must often find fault with the gods. But to reverence
and honor thy own mind will make thee content with thyself, and in
harmony with society, and in agreement with the gods, that is,
praising all that they give and have ordered.</p>

<p><a name="vi._17" id="vi._17">17.</a> Above, below, all around
are the movements of the elements. But the motion of virtue is in
none of these: it is something more divine, and advancing by a way
hardly observed, it goes happily on its road.</p>

<p><a name="vi._18" id="vi._18">18.</a> How strangely men act!
They will not praise those who are living at the same time and
living with themselves; but to be themselves praised by posterity,
by those whom they have never seen nor ever will see, this they set
much value on. But this is very much the same as if thou shouldst
be grieved because those who have lived before thee did not praise
thee.</p>

<p>19. If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do
not think that it is impossible for man: but if anything is
possible for man and conformable to his nature, think that this can
be attained by thyself too.</p>

<p><a name="vi._20" id="vi._20">20.</a> In the gymnastic
exercises suppose that a man has torn thee with his nails, and by
dashing against thy head has inflicted a wound. Well, we neither
show any signs of vexation, nor are we offended, nor do we suspect
him afterwards as a treacherous fellow; and yet we are on our guard
against him, not however as an enemy, nor yet with suspicion, but
we quietly get out of his way. Something like this let thy behavior
be in all the other parts of life; let us overlook many things in
those who are like antagonists in the gymnasium. For it is in our
power, as I said, to get out of the way, and to have no suspicion
nor hatred.</p>

<p>21. If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not

which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his
error and ignorance.</p>

gods, and do not perplex thyself about the length of time in which
thou shalt do this; for even three hours so spent are
sufficient.</p>

we call Cosmos, exist in it at the same time.</p>

they grow angry, wilt thou be angry too? Wilt thou not go on with
composure and number every letter? Just so then in this life also
remember that every duty is made up of certain parts. These it is
thy duty to observe, and without being disturbed or showing anger
towards those who are angry with thee, to go on thy way and finish
that which is set before thee.</p>

<p><a name="vi._27" id="vi._27">27.</a> How cruel it is not to
allow men to strive After the things which appear to them to be
suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in a manner thou
dost not allow them to do this, when thou art vexed because they do

suppose them to be suitable to their nature and profitable to them.
But it is not so. Teach them then, and show them without being
angry.</p>

such things happen. Keep thyself then simple, good, pure, serious,
free from affectation, a friend of justice, a worshipper of the
gods, kind, affectionate, strenuous in all proper acts. Strive to
continue to be such as philosophy wished to make thee. Reverence
the gods, and help men. Short is life. There is only one fruit of
this terrene life&mdash;a pious disposition and social acts. Do
everything as a disciple of Antoninus. Remember his constancy in
every act which was conformable to reason, and his evenness in all
things, and his piety, and the serenity of his countenance, and his
sweetness, and his disregard of empty fame, and his efforts to
understand things; and how he would never let anything pass without
having first most carefully examined it and clearly understood it;
and how he bore with those who blamed him unjustly without blaming
them in return; how he did nothing in a hurry; and how he listened
not to calumnies, and how exact an examiner of manners and actions
he was; and not given to reproach people, nor timid, nor
suspicious, nor a sophist; and with how little he was satisfied,
such as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants; and how laborious and
patient; and how he was able on account of his sparing diet to hold
out to the evening, not even requiring to relieve himself by any
evacuations except at the usual hour; and his firmness and
uniformity in his friendships; and how he tolerated freedom of
speech in those who opposed his opinions; and the pleasure that he
had when any man showed him anything better; and how religious he
was without superstition. Imitate all this, that thou mayest have
as good a conscience, when thy last hour comes, as he had (<a href=
"#i._16">i. 16</a>).</p>

<p>31. Return to thy sober senses and call thyself back; and when

those which are done with reference to the present; for as to the

All things are little, changeable, perishable. All things come from
thence, from that universal ruling power, either directly
proceeding or by way of sequence. And accordingly the lion's gaping
jaws, and that which is poisonous, and every harmful thing, as a
thorn, as mud, are after-products of the grand and beautiful. Do

power which made them; wherefore the more is it fit to reverence
this power, and to think, that, if thou dost live and act according
to its will, everything in thee is in conformity to intelligence.
And thus also in the universe the things which belong to it are in
conformity to intelligence.</p>

them from this or to the whole, which is the special object of

however the gods determine about none of the things which concern

that which is useful; and that is useful to every man which is

To that place then we must remove, where there are so many great

myself or with another I can do, ought to be directed to this only,

been constituted for the sake of rational beings, just as among
irrational things the inferior for the sake of the superior, but
the rational for the sake of one another.</p>

<p>The prime principle then in man's constitution is the social.
And the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the
body,&mdash;for it is the peculiar office of the rational and
intelligent motion to circumscribe itself, and never to be
overpowered either by the motion of the senses or of the appetites,
for both are animal: but the intelligent motion claims superiority,
and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others. And
with good reason, for it is formed by nature to use all of them.
The third thing in the rational constitution is freedom from error
and from deception. Let then the ruling principle holding fast to
these things go straight on, and it has what is its own.</p>

he was able to be content with being just towards men and pious
towards the gods, neither idly vexed on account of men's villainy,
nor yet making himself a slave to any man's ignorance, nor

mingled+ [the intelligence] with the composition of the body, as
not to have allowed thee the power of circumscribing thyself and of
bringing under subjection to thyself all that is thy own; for it is
very possible to be a divine man and to be recognized as such by no
one. Always bear this in mind; and another thing too, that very
little indeed is necessary for living a happy life. And because
thou hast despaired of becoming a dialectician and skilled in the
knowledge of nature, do not for this reason renounce the hope of
being both free and modest, and social and obedient to God.</p>

<p><a name="vii._68" id="vii._68">68.</a> It is in thy power to
live free from all compulsion in the greatest tranquillity of mind,
even if all the world cry out against thee as much as they choose,
and even if wild beasts tear in pieces the members of this kneaded
matter which has grown around thee. For what hinders the mind in
the midst of all this from maintaining itself in tranquillity and
in a just judgment of all surrounding things and in a ready use of
the objects which are presented to it, so that the judgment may say
to the thing which falls under its observation: This thou art in
substance [reality], though in men's opinion thou mayest appear to
be of a different kind; and the use shall say to that which falls
under the hand: Thou art the thing that I was seeking; for to me
that which presents itself is always a material for virtue both
rational and political, and in a word, for the exercise of art,
which belongs to man or God. For everything which happens has a
relationship either to God or man, and is neither new nor difficult
to handle, but usual and apt matter to work on.</p>

the bad, and this too when thou art one of
them?</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_108" id="Footnote_A_108" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_108">[A]</a> It is not easy
to understand this section. It has been suggested that there is
some error in <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ê alogista">&#x1f22; &#x1f00;&lambda;&#x1f79;&gamma;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;
</ins>, &amp;c. Some of the translators have made nothing of the passage,
and they have somewhat perverted the words. The first proposition
is, that the universe was made by some sufficient power. A
beginning of the universe is assumed, and a power which framed an
order. The next question is, How are things produced now? Or, in
other words, by what power do forms appear in continuous
succession? The answer, according to Antoninus, may be this: It is
by virtue of the original constitution of things that all change
and succession have been effected and are effected. And this is
intelligible in a sense, if we admit that the universe is always
one and the same, a continuity of identity; as much one and the
same as man is one and the same&mdash;which he believes himself to
be, though he also believes, and cannot help believing, that both
in his body and in his thoughts there is change and succession.
There is no real discontinuity then in the universe; and if we say
that there was an order framed in the beginning, and that the
things which are now produced are a consequence of a previous
arrangement, we speak of things as we are compelled to view them,
as forming a series of succession, just as we speak of the changes
in our own bodies and the sequence of our own thoughts. But as
there are no .intervals, not even intervals infinitely small,
between any two supposed states of any one thing, so there are no
intervals, not even infinitely small, between what we call one
thing and any other thing which we speak of as immediately
preceding or following it. What we call time is an idea derived
from our notion of a succession of things or events, an idea which
is a part of our constitution, but not an idea which we can suppose
to belong to an infinite intelligence and power. The conclusion
then is certain that the present and the past, the production of
present things and the supposed original order, out of which we say
that present things now come, are one, and the present productive
power and the so-called past arrangement are only different names
for one thing. I suppose then that Antoninus wrote here as people
sometimes talk now, and that his real meaning is not exactly
expressed by his words. There are certainly other passages from
which I think that we may collect that he had notions of production
something like what I have expressed.</p>

<p>We now come to the alternate: "or even the chief things ...
principle." I do not exactly know what he means by

<ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: ta kureôtata"> &tau;&#x1f70;
&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&#x1f7d;&tau;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;</ins> "the
chief," or "the most excellent," or whatever it is. But as he
speaks elsewhere of inferior and superior things, and of the
inferior being for the use of the superior, and of rational beings
being the highest, he may here mean rational beings. He also in
this alternative assumes a governing power of the universe, and
that it acts by directing its power towards these chief objects, or
making its special, proper motion towards them. And here he uses
the noun <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hormê">(&#x1f41;&rho;&mu;&#x1fc4;)</ins> "movement," which contains the
same notion as the verb <ins class="greek"
 title="Greek: hôrmêse">(&#x1f61;&rho;&mu;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;</ins>)
"moved," which he used at the beginning of the paragraph, when he
was speaking of the making of the universe. If we do not accept the
first hypothesis, he says, we must take the conclusion of the
second, that the "chief things towards which the ruling power of
the universe directs its own movement are governed by no rational
principle." The meaning then is, if there is a meaning in it, that
though there is a governing power which strives to give effect to
its efforts, we must conclude that there is no rational direction
of anything, if the power which first made the universe does not in
some way govern it still. Besides, if we assume that anything is
now produced or now exists without the action of the supreme
intelligence, and yet that this intelligence makes an effort to
act, we obtain a conclusion which cannot be reconciled with the
nature of a supreme power, whose existence Antoninus always
assumes. The tranquillity that a man may gain from these
reflections must result from his rejecting the second hypothesis
and accepting the first&mdash;whatever may be the exact sense in
which the emperor understood the first. Or, as he says elsewhere,
if there is no Providence which governs the world, man has at least
the power of governing himself according to the constitution of his
nature; and so he may be tranquil if he does the best that he
can.</p>

<p>If there is no error in the passage, it is worth the labor to
discover the writer's exact meaning&mdash;for I think that he had a
meaning, though people may not agree what it was. (Compare ix. 28.)
If I have rightly explained the emperor's meaning in this and other
passages, he has touched the solution of a great question.</p>

to the removal of the desire of empty fame, that it is no longer in
thy power to have lived the whole of thy life, or at least thy life
from thy youth upwards, like a philosopher; but both to many others
and to thyself it is plain that thou art far from philosophy. Thou
hast fallen into disorder then, so that it is no longer easy for
thee to get the reputation of a philosopher; and thy plan of life
also opposes it. If then thou hast truly seen where the matter
lies, throw away the thought, How thou shall seem [to others], and
be content if thou shalt live the rest of thy life in such wise as
thy nature wills. Observe then what it wills, and let nothing else
distract thee; for thou hast had experience of many wanderings
without having found happiness anywhere,&mdash;not in syllogisms,
nor in wealth, nor in reputation, nor in enjoyment, nor anywhere.
Where is it then? In doing what man's nature requires. How then
shall a man do this? If he has principles from which come his
affects and his acts. What principles? Those which relate to good

the things which are in its power, and when it is satisfied with
everything that is assigned to it by the common nature. For of this
common nature every particular nature is a part, as the nature of

plant the nature of the leaf is part of a nature which has not
perception or reason, and is subject to be impeded; but the nature

perceptions of sense is an evil to the animal nature. Hindrance to
the movements [desires] is equally an evil to the animal nature.
And something else also is equally an impediment and an evil to the
constitution of plants. So then that which is a hindrance to the
intelligence is an evil to the intelligent nature. Apply all these
things then to thyself. Does pain or sensuous pleasure affect thee?
The senses will look to that. Has any obstacle opposed thee in thy
efforts towards an object? If indeed thou wast making this effort
absolutely [unconditionally, or without any reservation], certainly
this obstacle is an evil to thee considered as a rational animal.
But if thou takest [into consideration] the usual course of things,
thou hast not yet been injured nor even impeded. The things however
which are proper to the understanding no other man is used to

Therefore the mind which is free from passions is a citadel, for

he is in danger, I do not see. Thus then always abide by the first

be ridiculed by a carpenter and shoemaker if thou didst find fault
because thou seest in their workshop shavings and cuttings from the
things which they make. And yet they have places into which they
can throw these shavings and cuttings, and the universal nature has
no external space; but the wondrous part of her art is that though
she has circumscribed herself, everything within her which appears
to decay and to grow old and to be useless she changes into
herself, and again makes other new things from these very same, so
that she requires neither substance from without nor wants a place
into which she may cast that which decays. She is content then with
her own space, and her own matter, and her own art.</p>

<p>Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee. What
then can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure,
wise, sober, just? For instance, if a man should stand by a limpid
pure spring, and curse it, the spring never ceases sending up
potable water; and if he should cast clay into it or filth, it will
speedily disperse them and wash them out, and will not be at all

but there the light remains fixed and does not glide or fall off.
Such then ought to be the outpouring and diffusion of the
understanding, and it should in no way be an effusion, but an

<p><a name="ix._1" id="ix._1"></a> He who acts unjustly acts
impiously. For since the universal nature has made rational animals
for the sake of one another, to help one another according to their
deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses
her will is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity.
And he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for
the universal nature is the nature of things that are; and things
that are have a relation to all things that come into existence.<a
name="FNanchor_A_118" id="FNanchor_A_118" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_118" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> And further, this
universal nature is named truth, and is the prime cause of all
things that are true. He then who lies intentionally is guilty of
impiety, inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving; and he also who
lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the
universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting
against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is
moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth, for he had
received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not
able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who
pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of
impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with the
universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and
the good contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are
in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure
pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things
which cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will
sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in
the world, and even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure
will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now
with respect to the things towards which the universal nature is
equally affected&mdash;for it would not have made both, unless it
was equally affected towards both&mdash;towards these they who wish
to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and equally
affected. With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and
life, or honor and dishonor, which the universal nature employs
equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting
impiously. And I say that the universal nature employs them
equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to those who are
produced in continuous series and to those who come after them by
virtue of a certain original movement of Providence, according to
which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of things,
having conceived certain principles of the things which were to be,
and having determined powers productive of beings and of changes
and of such like successions (<a href="#vii._75">vii. 75</a>).</p>

<p><a name="ix._2" id="ix._2">2.</a> It would be a man's happiest
lot to depart from mankind without having had any taste of lying
and hypocrisy and luxury and pride. However, to breathe out one's
life when a man has had enough of these things is the next best
voyage, as the saying is. Hast thou determined to abide with vice,
and hast not experience yet induced thee to fly from this
pestilence? For the destruction of the understanding is a
pestilence, much more, indeed, than any such corruption and change
of this atmosphere which surrounds us. For this corruption is a
pestilence of animals so far as they are animals; but the other is
a pestilence of men so far as they are men.</p>

increase and to reach maturity, and to have teeth and beard and
gray hairs, and to beget and to be pregnant and to bring forth, and
all the other natural operations which the seasons of thy life
bring, such also is dissolution. This, then, is consistent with the
character of a reflecting man&mdash;to be neither careless nor
impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death, but to wait for
it as one of the operations of nature. As thou now waitest for the
time when the child shall come out of thy wife's womb, so be ready
for the time when thy soul shall fall out of this envelope.<a name=

of comfort which shall reach thy heart, thou wilt be made best
reconciled to death by observing the objects from which thou art
going to be removed, and the morals of those with whom thy soul
will no longer be mingled. For it is no way right to be offended
with men, but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them
gently; and yet to remember that thy departure will not be from men
who have the same principles as thyself. For this is the only
thing, if there be any, which could draw us the contrary way and
attach us to life,&mdash;to be permitted to live with those who
have the same principles as ourselves. But now thou seest how great
is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who live
together, so that thou mayst say, Come quick, O death, lest
perchance I, too, should forget myself.</p>

<p><a name="ix._8" id="ix._8">8.</a> Among the animals which have
not reason one life is distributed; but among reasonable animals
one intelligent soul is distributed: just as there is one earth of
all things which are of an earthly nature, and we see by one light,
and breathe one air, all of us that have the faculty of vision and
all that have life.</p>

<p><a name="ix._9" id="ix._9">9.</a> All things which participate
in anything which is common to them all, move towards that which is
of the same kind with themselves. Everything which is earthy turns
towards the earth, everything which is liquid flows together, and
everything which is of an aerial kind does the same, so that they
require something to keep them asunder, and the application of
force. Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire,
but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which
is here, that even every substance which is somewhat dry is easily
ignited, because there is less mingled with it of that which is a
hindrance to ignition. Accordingly, then, everything also which
participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like manner
towards that which is of the same kind with itself, or moves even
more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other
things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and
to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among
animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of
cattle, and the nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for
even in animals there are souls, and that power which brings them
together is seen to exert itself in a superior degree, and in such
a way as never has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in
trees. But in rational animals there are political communities and
friendships, and families and meetings of people; and in wars,
treaties, and armistices. But in the things which are still
superior, even though they are separated from one another, unity in
a manner exists, as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher
degree is able to produce a sympathy even in things which are
separated. See, then, what now takes place; for only intelligent
animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and inclination, and
in them alone the property of flowing together is not seen. But
still, though men strive to avoid [this union], they are caught and
held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and thou wilt
see what I say, if thou only observest. Sooner, then, will one find
anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing, than a
man altogether separated from other men.</p>

proper seasons each produces it. But and if usage has especially

itself.</p>

says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me; but I
continued to discourse on the nature of things as before, keeping
to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such
movements as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from
perturbations and maintain its proper good. Nor did I, he says,
give the physicians an opportunity of putting on solemn looks, as
if they were doing something great, but my life went on well and
happily. Do, then, the same that he did both in sickness, if thou
art sick, and in any other circumstances; for never to desert
philosophy in any events that may befall us, nor to hold trifling
talks either with an ignorant man or with one unacquainted with
nature, is a principle of all schools of philosophy; but to be

<p><a name="ix._42" id="ix._42">42.</a> When thou art offended

possible, then, that shameless men should not be in the world? It
is not possible. Do not, then, require what is impossible. For this
man also is one of those shameless men who must of necessity be in
the world. Let the same considerations be present to thy mind in
the case of the knave, and the faithless man, and of every man who
does wrong in any way. For at the same time that thou dost remind
thyself that it is impossible that such kind of men should not
exist, thou wilt become more kindly disposed towards every one
individually. It is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when
the occasion arises, what virtue nature has given to man to oppose
to every wrongful act. For she has given to man, as an antidote
against the stupid man, mildness, and against another kind of man
some other power. And in all cases it is possible for thee to
correct by teaching the man who is gone astray; for every man who
errs misses his object and is gone astray. Besides, wherein hast
thou been injured? For thou wilt find that no one among those
against whom thou art irritated has done anything by which thy mind
could be made worse; but that which is evil to thee and harmful has
its foundation only in the mind. And what harm is done or what is
there strange, if the man who has not been instructed does the acts
of an uninstructed man? Consider whether thou shouldst not rather
blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man to err in
such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason to
suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and yet
thou hast forgotten and art amazed that he has erred. But most of
all when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to
thyself. For the fault is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst
trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise,
or when conferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it
absolutely, nor yet in such way as to have received from thy very
act all the profit. For what more dost thou want when thou hast
done a man a service? art thou not content that thou hast done
something conformable to thy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid
for it? just as if the eye demanded a recompense for seeing, or the

<p><a name="x._6" id="x._6">6.</a> Whether the universe is [a
concourse of] atoms, or nature [is a system], let this first be
established, that I am a part of the whole which is governed by
nature; next, I am in a manner intimately related to the parts
which are of the same kind with myself. For remembering this,
inasmuch as I am a part, I shall be discontented with none of the
things which are assigned to me out of the whole; for nothing is
injurious to the part if it is for the advantage of the whole. For
the whole contains nothing which is not for its advantage; and all
natures indeed have this common principle, but the nature of the
universe has this principle besides, that it cannot be compelled
even by any external cause to generate anything harmful to itself.
By remembering, then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be
content with everything that happens. And inasmuch as I am in a
manner intimately related to the parts which are of the same kind
with myself, I shall do nothing unsocial, but I shall rather direct
myself to the things which are of the same kind with myself, and I
shall turn all my efforts to the common interest, and divert them
from the contrary. Now, if these things are done so, life must flow
on happily, just as thou mayst observe that the life of a citizen
is happy, who continues a course of action which is advantageous to
his fellow-citizens, and is content with whatever the state may
assign to him.</p>

<p><a name="x._7" id="x._7">7.</a> The parts of the whole,
everything, I mean, which is naturally comprehended in the
universe, must of necessity perish; but let this be understood in
this sense, that they must undergo change. But if this is naturally
both an evil and a necessity for the parts, the whole would not
continue to exist in a good condition, the parts being subject to
change and constituted so as to perish in various ways. For whether
did Nature herself design to do evil to the things which are parts
of herself, and to make them subject to evil and of necessity fall
into evil, or have such results happened without her knowing it?
Both these suppositions, indeed, are incredible. But if a man
should even drop the term Nature [as an efficient power], and
should speak of these things as natural, even then it would be
ridiculous to affirm at the same time that the parts of the whole
are in their nature subject to change, and at the same time to be
surprised or vexed as if something were happening contrary to
nature, particularly as the dissolution of things is into those
things of which each thing is composed. For there is either a
dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been
compounded, or a change from the solid to the earthy and from the
airy to the aerial, so that these parts are taken back into the
universal reason, whether this at certain periods is consumed by
fire or renewed by eternal changes. And do not imagine that the
solid and the airy part belong to thee from the time of generation.
For all this received its accretion only yesterday and the day
before, as one may say, from the food and the air which is
inspired. This, then, which has received [the accretion], changes,
not that which thy mother brought forth. But suppose that this
[which thy mother brought forth] implicates thee very much with
that other part, which has the peculiar quality [of change], this
is nothing in fact in the way of objection to what is said.<a name=

this section is perhaps corrupt. The meaning is very obscure. I
have given that meaning which appears to be consistent with the
whole argument. The emperor here maintains that the essential part
of man is unchangeable, and that the other parts, if they change or
perish, do not affect that which really constitutes the man. See
the Philosophy of Antoninus, p. 56, note 2. Schultz supposed "thy

names, good, modest, true, rational, a man of equanimity, and
magnanimous, take care that thou dost not change these names; and
if thou shouldst lose them, quickly return to them. And remember
that the term Rational was intended to signify a discriminating
attention to every several thing, and freedom from negligence; and
that Equanimity is the voluntary acceptance of the things which are
assigned to thee by the common nature; and that Magnanimity is the
elevation of the intelligent part above the pleasurable or painful
sensations of the flesh, and above that poor thing called fame, and
death, and all such things. If, then, thou maintainest thyself in
the possession of these names, without desiring to be called by
these names by others, thou wilt be another person and wilt enter
on another life. For to continue to be such as thou hast hitherto
been, and to be torn in pieces and defiled in such a life, is the
character of a very stupid man and one over-fond of his life, and
like those half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who though
covered with wounds and gore, still intreat to be kept to the

fallest out of them and dost not maintain thy hold, go courageously
into some nook where thou shalt maintain them, or even depart at
once from life, not in passion, but with simplicity and freedom and
modesty, after doing this one [laudable] thing at least in thy
life, to have gone out of it thus. In order, however to the
remembrance of these names, it will greatly help thee if thou
rememberest the gods, and that they wish not to be flattered, but
wish all reasonable beings to be made like themselves; and if thou
rememberest that what does the work of a fig-tree is a fig-tree,
and that what does the work of a dog is a dog, and that what does
the work of a bee is a bee, and that what does the work of a man is
a man.</p>

Diomedes, as we see in the Scolion of Harmodius and Aristogiton.
Sertorius heard of the islands at Cadiz from some sailors who had
been there; and he had a wish to go and live in them and rest from
his troubles (Plutarch, Sertorius, c. 8). In the Odyssey, Proteus
told Menelaus that he should not die in Argos, but be removed to a
place at the boundary of the earth where Rhadamanthus dwelt
(Odyssey, iv. 565):&mdash;</p>

<p>It is certain that the writer of the Odyssey only follows some

thou hast looked on thyself, think of any other Caesar, and in the
case of every one do in like manner. Then let this thought be in
thy mind, Where then are those men? Nowhere, or nobody knows where.
For thus continuously thou wilt look at human things as smoke and
nothing at all; especially if thou reflectest at the same time that
what has once changed will never exist again in the infinite
duration of time. But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy
existence? And why art thou not content to pass through this short
time in an orderly way? What matter and opportunity [for thy
activity] art thou avoiding? For what else are all these things,
except exercises for the reason, when it has viewed carefully and
by examination into their nature the things which happen in life?
Persevere then until thou shalt have made these things thy own, as

blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is
thrown into it.</p>

<p><a name="x._33" id="x._33">33.</a> What is that which as to
this material [our life] can be done or said in the way most
conformable to reason? For whatever this may be, it is in thy power
to do it or to say it, and do not make excuses that thou art
hindered. Thou wilt not cease to lament till thy mind is in such a
condition that what luxury is to those who enjoy pleasure, such
shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented to
thee, the doing of the things which are conformable to man's
constitution; for a man ought to consider as an enjoyment
everything which it is in his power to do according to his own
nature. And it is in his power everywhere. Now, it is not given to
a cylinder to move everywhere by its own motion, nor yet to water
nor to fire, nor to anything else which is governed by nature or an
irrational soul, for the things which check them and stand in the
way are many. But intelligence and reason are able to go through
everything that opposes them, and in such manner as they are formed
by nature and as they choose. Place before thy eyes this facility
with which the reason will be carried through all things, as fire
upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder down an inclined
surface, and seek for nothing further. For all other obstacles
either affect the body only, which is a dead thing; or, except
through opinion and the yielding of the reason itself, they do not
crush nor do any harm of any kind; for if they did, he who felt it
would immediately become bad. Now, in the case of all things which
have a certain constitution, whatever harm may happen to any of
them, that which is so affected becomes consequently worse; but in
the like case, a man becomes both better, if one may say so, and
more worthy of praise by making a right use of these accidents. And
finally remember that nothing harms him who is really a citizen,
which does not harm the state; nor yet does anything harm the
state, which does not harm law [order]; and of these things which
are called misfortunes not one harms law. What then does not harm
law does not harm either state or citizen.</p>

the season of spring," as the poet says; then the wind casts them
down; then the forest produces other leaves in their places. But a
brief existence is common to all things, and yet thou avoidest and
pursuest all things as if they would be eternal. A little time, and
thou shalt close thy eyes; and him who has attended thee to thy

wherever the limit of life may be fixed. Not as in a dance and in a

<p>After tragedy the old comedy was introduced, which had a
magisterial freedom of speech, and by its very plainness of
speaking was useful in reminding men to beware of insolence; and
for this purpose too Diogenes used to take from these writers.</p>

</div>

<p>But as to the middle comedy, which came next, observe what it
was, and again, for what object the new comedy was introduced,
which gradually sank down into a mere mimic artifice. That some
good things are said even by these writers, everybody knows: but
the whole plan of such poetry and dramaturgy, to what end does it
look?</p>

<p>7. How plain does it appear that there is not another condition
of life so well suited for philosophizing as this in which thou now
happenest to be.</p>

<p><a name="xi._8" id="xi._8">8.</a> A branch cut off from the
adjacent branch must of necessity be cut off from the whole tree
also. So too a man when he is separated from another man has fallen
off from the whole social community. Now as to a branch, another
cuts it off; but a man by his own act separates himself from his
neighbor when he hates him and turns away from him, and he does not
know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole
social system. Yet he has this privilege certainly from Zeus, who
framed society, for it is in our power to grow again to that which
is near to us, and again to become a part which helps to make up
the whole. However, if it often happens, this kind of separation,
it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought
to unity and to be restored to its former condition. Finally, the
branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, and has
continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after
being cut off is then ingrafted, for this is something like what
the gardeners mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the
tree, but+ that it has not the same mind with it.</p>

<p><a name="xi._9" id="xi._9">9.</a> As those who try to stand in
thy way when thou art proceeding according to right reason will not
be able to turn thee aside from thy proper action, so neither let
them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings toward them, but be on
thy guard equally in both matters, not only in the matter of steady
judgment and action, but also in the matter of gentleness to those
who try to hinder or otherwise trouble thee. For this also is a
weakness, to be vexed at them, as well as to be diverted from thy
course of action and to give way through fear; for both are equally
deserters from their post,&mdash;the man who does it through fear,
and the man who is alienated from him who is by nature a kinsman
and a friend.</p>

<p><a name="xi._10" id="xi._10">10.</a> There is no nature which
is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the natures of things. But
if this is so, that nature which is the most perfect and the most
comprehensive of all natures, cannot fall short of the skill of art
Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior;
therefore the universal nature does so too. And, indeed, hence is
the origin of justice, and in justice the other virtues have their
foundation: for justice will not be observed, if we either care for
middle things [things indifferent], or are easily deceived and
careless and changeable (<a href="#v._16">v. 16</a>, <a href=

avoidances of which disturb thee, still in a manner thou goest to
them. Let then thy judgment about them be at rest, and they will
remain quiet, and thou wilt not be seen either pursuing or
avoiding.</p>

<p><a name="xi._12" id="xi._12">12.</a> The spherical form of the

that I be not discovered doing or saying anything deserving of

mild and benevolent towards every man, and ready to show even him
his mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a display of my
endurance, but nobly and honestly, like the great Phocion, unless
indeed he only assumed it. For the interior [parts] ought to be
such, and a man ought to be seen by the gods neither dissatisfied
with anything nor complaining. For what evil is it to thee, if thou
art now doing what is agreeable to thy own nature, and art
satisfied with that which at this moment is suitable to the nature
of the universe, since thou art a human being placed at thy post in
order that what is for the common advantage may be done in some

be plainly written on the forehead. Such as a man's character is,+
he immediately shows it in his eyes, just as he who is beloved
forthwith reads everything in the eyes of lovers. The man who is
honest and good ought to be exactly like a man who smells strong,
so that the bystander as soon as he comes near him must smell
whether he choose or not. But the affectation of simplicity is like

way, this power is in the soul, if it be indifferent to things
which are indifferent. And it will be indifferent, if it looks on
each of these things separately and all together, and if it
remembers that not one of them produces in us an opinion about
itself, nor comes to us; but these things remain immovable, and it
is we ourselves who produce the judgments about them, and, as we
may say, write them in ourselves, it being in our power not to
write them, and it being in our power, if perchance these judgments
have imperceptibly got admission to our minds, to wipe them out;
and if we remember also that such attention will only be for a
short time, and then life will be at an end. Besides, what trouble
is there at all in doing this? For if these things are according to
nature, rejoice in them and they will be easy to thee: but if
contrary to nature, seek what is conformable to thy own nature, and
strive towards this, even if it bring no reputation; for every man
is allowed to seek his own good.</p>

<p>17. Consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists,
+ and into what it changes, and what kind of a thing it will be
when it has changed, and that it will sustain no harm.</p>

<p><a name="xi._18" id="xi._18">18.</a> [If any have offended
against thee, consider first]: What is my relation to men, and that
we are made for one another; and in another respect I was made to
be set over them, as a ram over the flock or a bull over the herd.
But examine the matter from first principles, from this. If all
things are not mere atoms, it is nature which orders all things: if
this is so, the inferior things exist for the sake of the superior,
and these for the sake of one another (<a href="#ii._1">ii. 1</a>;
<a href="#ix._39">ix. 39</a>; <a href="#v._16">v. 16</a>; <a
href="#iii._4">iii. 4</a>).</p>

so forth; and particularly, under what compulsions in respect of
opinions they are; and as to their acts, consider with what pride
they do what they do (<a href="#viii._14">viii. 14</a>; <a href=
"#ix._34">ix. 34</a>).</p>

<p>Third, that if men do rightly what they do, we ought not to be
displeased: but if they do not right, it is plain that they do so
involuntarily and in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly
deprived of the truth, so also is it unwillingly deprived of the
power of behaving to each man according to his deserts. Accordingly
men are pained when they are called unjust, ungrateful, and greedy,
and in a word wrong-doers to their neighbors (<a href=

<p>Fourth, consider that thou also doest many things wrong, and
that thou art a man like others; and even if thou dost abstain from
certain faults, still thou hast the disposition to commit them,
though either through cowardice, or concern about reputation, or
some such mean motive, thou dost abstain from such faults (<a href=
"#i._17">i. 17</a>).</p>

<p>Fifth, consider that thou dost not even understand whether men
are doing wrong or not, for many things are done with a certain
reference to circumstances. And in short, a man must learn a great
deal to enable him to pass a correct judgment on another man's acts
(<a href="#ix._38">ix. 38</a>; <a href="#iv._51">iv. 51</a>).</p>

<p>Sixth, consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man's
life is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out
dead (<a href="#vii._58">vii. 58</a>; <a href="#iv._48">iv.
48</a>).</p>

<p>Seventh, that it is not men's acts which disturb us, for those
acts have their foundation in men's ruling principles, but it is
our own opinions which disturb us. Take away these opinions then,
and resolve to dismiss thy judgment about an act as if it were
something grievous, and thy anger is gone. How then shall I take
away these opinions? By reflecting that no wrongful act of another
brings shame on thee: for unless that which is shameful is alone
bad, thou also must of necessity do many things wrong, and become a
robber and everything else (<a href="#v._25">v. 25</a>; <a href=
"#vi._16">vii. 16</a>).</p>

<p>Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the
anger and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves,
at which we are angry and vexed (<a href="#iv._39">iv. 39</a>, <a
href="#iv._49">49</a>; <a href="#vii._24">vii. 24</a>).</p>

<p>Ninth, consider that a good disposition is invincible if it be
genuine, and not an affected smile and acting a part. For what will
the most violent man do to thee, if thou continuest to be of a kind
disposition towards him, and if, as opportunity offers, thou gently
admonishest him and calmly correctest his errors at the very time
when he is trying to do thee harm, saying, Not so, my child: we are
constituted by nature for something else: I shall certainly not be
injured, but thou art injuring thyself, my child.&mdash;And show
him with gentle tact and by general principles that this is so, and
that even bees do not do as he does, nor any animals which are
formed by nature to be gregarious. And thou must do this neither
with any double meaning nor in the way of reproach, but
affectionately and without any rancor in thy soul; and not as if
thou wert lecturing him, nor yet that any bystander may admire, but
either when he is alone, and if others are present ... <a name=

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_149" id="Footnote_A_149" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_149">[A]</a> It appears
that there is a defect in the text here.</p>
</div>

<p>Remember these nine rules, as if thou hadst received them as a
gift from the Muses, and begin at last to be a man while thou
livest. But thou must equally avoid nattering men and being vexed
at them, for both are unsocial and lead to harm. And let this truth
be present to thee in the excitement of anger, that to be moved by
passion is not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they are
more agreeable to human nature, so also are they more manly; and he
who possesses these qualities possesses strength, nerves, and
courage, and not the man who is subject to fits of passion and
discontent. For in the same degree in which a man's mind is nearer
to freedom from all passion, in the same degree also is it nearer
to strength: and as the sense of pain is a characteristic of
weakness, so also is anger. For he who yields to pain and he who
yields to anger, both are wounded and both submit.</p>

<p>But if thou wilt, receive also a tenth present from the leader
of the Muses [Apollo], and it is this,&mdash;that to expect bad men
not to do wrong is madness, for he who expects this desires an
impossibility. But to allow men to behave so to others, and to
expect them not to do thee any wrong, is irrational and
tyrannical.</p>

<p><a name="xi._19" id="xi._19">19.</a> There are four principal
aberrations of the superior faculty against which thou shouldst be
constantly on thy guard, and when thou hast detected them, thou
shouldst wipe them out and say on each occasion thus: This thought
is not necessary: this tends to destroy social union: this which
thou art going to say comes not from the real thoughts; for thou
shouldst consider it among the most absurd of things for a man not
to speak from his real thoughts. But the fourth is when thou shalt
reproach thyself for anything, for this is an evidence of the
diviner part within thee being overpowered and yielding to the less
honorable and to the perishable part, the body, and to its gross
pleasures (<a href="#iv._24">iv. 24</a>; <a href="#ii._16">ii.

<p><a name="xi._20" id="xi._20">20.</a> Thy aerial part and all
the fiery parts which are mingled in thee, though by nature they
have an upward tendency, still in obedience to the disposition of
the universe they are overpowered here in the compound mass [the
body]. And also the whole of the earthy part in thee and the
watery, though their tendency is downward, still are raised up and
occupy a position which is not their natural one. In this manner
then the elemental parts obey the universal; for when they have
been fixed in any place, perforce they remain there until again the
universal shall sound the signal for dissolution. Is it not then
strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and
discontented with its own place? And yet no force is imposed on it,
but only those things which are conformable to its nature: still it
does not submit, but is carried in the opposite direction. For the
movement towards injustice and intemperance and to anger and grief
and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from
nature. And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with
anything that happens, then too it deserts its post: for it is
constituted for piety and reverence towards the gods no less than
for justice. For these qualities also are comprehended under the
generic term of contentment with the constitution of things, and
indeed they are prior<a name="FNanchor_A_150" id=
"FNanchor_A_150" /><a href="#Footnote_A_150" class=

 title="Greek: presbytera">&pi;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&beta;&#x3cd;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;</ins>,
which is here translated "prior," may also mean "superior;" but
Antoninus seems to say that piety and reverence of the gods precede
all virtues, and that other virtues are derived from them, even
justice, which in another passage (<a href="#xi._10">xi. 10</a>)
he makes the foundation of all virtues. The ancient notion of
justice is that of giving to every one his due. It is not a legal
definition, as some have supposed, but a moral rule which law
cannot in all cases enforce. Besides, law has its own rules, which
are sometimes moral and sometimes immoral; but it enforces them all
simply because they are general rules, and if it did not or could
not enforce them, so far Law would not be Law. Justice, or the
doing what is just, implies a universal rule and obedience to it;
and as we all live under universal Law, which commands both our
body and our intelligence, and is the law of our nature, that is,
the law of the whole constitution of a man, we must endeavor to
discover what this supreme Law is. It is the will of the power that
rules all. By acting in obedience to this will, we do justice, and
by consequence everything else that we ought to do.</p>

<p><a name="xi._21" id="xi._21">21.</a> He who has not one and
always the same object in life, cannot be one and the same all
through his life. But what I have said is not enough, unless this
also is added, what this object ought to be. For as there is not
the same opinion about all the things which in some way or other
are considered by the majority to be good, but only about some
certain things, that is, things which concern the common interest,
so also ought we to propose to ourselves an object which shall be
of a common kind [social] and political. For he who directs all his
own efforts to this object, will make all his acts alike, and thus
will always be the same.</p>

thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous road thou canst have now, if
thou dost not refuse them to thyself. And this means, if thou wilt
take no notice of all the past, and trust the future to providence,
and direct the present only conformably to piety and justice.
Conformably to piety that thou mayest be content with the lot which
is assigned to thee, for nature designed it for thee and thee for
it. Conformably to justice, that thou mayst always speak the truth
freely and without disguise, and do the things which are agreeable
to law and according to the worth of each. And let neither another
man's wickedness hinder thee, nor opinion nor voice, nor yet the
sensations of the poor flesh which has grown about thee; for the
passive part will look to this. If, then, whatever the time may be
when thou shalt be near to thy departure, neglecting everything
else thou shalt respect only thy ruling faculty and the divinity
within thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some
time cease to live, but if thou shalt fear never to have begun to
live according to nature&mdash;then thou wilt be a man worthy of

the external circumfluent vortex whirls round, so that the
intellectual power exempt from the things of fate can live pure and
free by itself, doing what is just and accepting what happens and
saying the truth: if thou wilt separate, I say, from this ruling

mankind, have overlooked this alone, that some men, and very good
men, and men who, as we may say, have had most communion with the
divinity, and through pious acts and religious observances have
been most intimate with the divinity, when they have once died
should never exist again, but should be completely
extinguished?</p>

<p>But if this is so, be assured that if it ought to have been
otherwise, the gods would have done it. For if it were just, it
would also be possible; and if it were according to nature, nature
would have had it so. But because it is not so, if in fact it is
not so, be thou convinced that it ought not to have been so: for
thou seest even of thyself that in this inquiry thou art disputing

proper time and the limit nature fixes, sometimes as in old age the
peculiar nature of man, but always the universal nature, by the
change of whose parts the whole universe continues ever young and
perfect.<a name="FNanchor_A_158" id="FNanchor_A_158" /><a href=
"#Footnote_A_158" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> And everything which is
useful to the universal is always good and in season. Therefore the
termination of life for every man is no evil, because neither is it
shameful, since it is both independent of the will and not opposed
to the general interest, but it is good, since it is seasonable,
and profitable to and congruent with the universal. For thus too he
is moved by the Deity who is moved in the same manner with the
Deity, and moved towards the same thing in his mind.</p>

<p>24. These three principles thou must have in readiness: In the
things which thou doest, do nothing either inconsiderately or
otherwise than as justice herself would act; but with respect to
what may happen to thee from without, consider that it happens
either by chance or according to providence, and thou must neither
blame chance nor accuse providence. Second, consider what every
being is from the seed to the time of its receiving a soul, and
from the reception of a soul to the giving back of the same, and of
what things every being is compounded, and into what things it is
resolved. Third, if thou shouldst suddenly be raised up above the
earth, and shouldst look down on human things, and observe the
variety of them how great it is, and at the same time also shouldst
see at a glance how great is the number of beings who dwell all
around in the air and the ether, consider that as often as thou
shouldst be raised up, thou wouldst see the same things, sameness
of form and shortness of duration. Are these things to be proud
of?</p>

<p><a name="xii._25" id="xii._25">25.</a> Cast away opinion: thou
art saved. Who then hinders thee from casting it away?</p>

<p><a name="xii._26" id="xii._26">26.</a> When thou art troubled
about anything, thou hast forgotten this, that all things happen
according to the universal nature; and forgotten this, that a man's
wrongful act is nothing to thee; and further thou hast forgotten
this, that everything which happens, always happened so and will
happen so, and now happens so everywhere; forgotten this too, how
close is the kinship between a man and the whole human race, for it
is a community, not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence.
And thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's intelligence is
a god and is an efflux of the Deity;<a name="FNanchor_A_159" id=
"FNanchor_A_159" /><a href="#Footnote_A_159" class=
"fnanchor">[A]</a> and forgotten this, that nothing is a man's own,
but that his child and his body and his very soul came from the
Deity; forgotten this, that everything is opinion; and lastly thou
hast forgotten that every man lives the present time only, and
loses only this.</p>

<p><a name="xii._27" id="xii._27">27.</a> Constantly bring to thy
recollection those who have complained greatly about anything,
those who have been most conspicuous by the greatest fame or
misfortunes or enmities or fortunes of any kind: then think where
are they all now? Smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale. And
let there be present to thy mind also everything of this sort, how
Fabius Catellinus lived in the country, and Lucius Lupus in his
gardens, and Stertinius at Briae, and Tiberius at Capreae, and
Velius Rufus [or Rufus at Velia]; and in fine think of the eager
pursuit of anything conjoined with pride;<a name="FNanchor_A_160"

violently strain; and how much more philosophical it is for a man

temperate, obedient to the gods, and to do this with all
simplicity: for the pride which is proud of its want of pride is
the most intolerable of all.</p>

<p><a name="xii._28" id="xii._28">28.</a> To those who ask, Where
hast thou seen the gods, or how dost thou comprehend that they
exist and so worshippest them, I answer, in the first place, they
may be seen even with the eyes;<a name="FNanchor_A_161" id=

"fnanchor">[A]</a> in the second place, neither have I seen even my

comprehend that they exist, and I venerate them.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_161" id="Footnote_A_161" /><a href=
"#FNanchor_A_161">[A]</a> "Seen even
with the eyes." It is supposed that this may be explained by the
Stoic doctrine, that the universe is a god or living being (<a
href="#iv._40">iv. 40</a>), and that the celestial bodies are gods
(<a href="#viii._19">viii. 19</a>). But the emperor may mean that
we know that the gods exist, as he afterwards states it, because we
see what they do; as we know that man has intellectual powers,
because we see what he does, and in no other way do we know it.
This passage then will agree with the passage in the Epistle to the
Romans (i. <i>v</i>. 20), and with the Epistle to the Colossians
(i. <i>v</i>. 15), in which Jesus Christ is named "the image of the
invisible god;" and with the passage in the Gospel of St. John
(xiv. <i>v</i>. 9).</p>

<p>Gataker, whose notes are a wonderful collection of learning, and
all of it sound and good, quotes a passage of Calvin which is
founded on St. Paul's language (Rom. i. <i>v</i>. 20): "God by
creating the universe [or world, mundum], being himself invisible,
has presented himself to our eyes conspicuously in a certain
visible form." He also quotes Seneca (De Benef. iv. c. 8):
"Quocunque te flexeris, ibi illum videbis occurrentem tibi: nihil
ab illo vacat, opus suum ipse implet." Compare also Cicero, De
Senectute (c. 22), Xenophon's Cyropaedia (viii. 7), and Mem. iv. 3;
also Epictetus, i. 6, de Providentia. I think that my
interpretation of Antoninus is right.</p>

<p>29. The safety of life is this, to examine everything all
through, what it is itself, that is its material, what the formal
part; with all thy soul to do justice and to say the truth. What
remains, except to enjoy life by joining one good thing to another
so as not to leave even the smallest intervals between?</p>

<p><a name="xii._30" id="xii._30">30.</a> There is one light of
the sun, though it is interrupted by walls, mountains, and other
things infinite. There is one common substance,<a name=
"FNanchor_A_162" id="FNanchor_A_162" /><a href="#Footnote_A_162"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> though it is distributed among countless
bodies which have their several qualities. There is one soul,
though it is distributed among infinite natures and individual
circumscriptions [or individuals]. There is one intelligent soul,
though it seems to be divided. Now in the things which have been
mentioned, all the other parts, such as those which are air and
matter, are without sensation and have no fellowship: and yet even
these parts the intelligent principle holds together and the
gravitation towards the same. But intellect in a peculiar manner
tends to that which is of the same kin, and combines with it, and
the feeling for communion is not interrupted.</p>

on all these things, turn to that which remains, which is to follow

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
